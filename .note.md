## Adding a new Unit

To add a New unit,

1. Add it in `labels.ts` making sure it is in the rightful year.

2. Add it in its group under `astro.sidebars.ts` and add an `autogenerate` attribute to it
to make sure the topics to be appended are infered automatically.

## Adding a topic

1. Navigate to the unit you want to add the unit. You can find it in `src/contents/docs`.

2. Add a file ending with `.md` or `.mdx` and name the file such that it is an alias of you
topic. The name of the file will be used as the URL.

3. In the created file, make sure to give a `title: ` attribute in the frontmatter.
The title will be used in the `<title>` of the page, the mini-sidebar and the title of the 
rendered markdown.
