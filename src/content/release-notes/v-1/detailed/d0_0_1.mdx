    ### Introducing dark mode

    We care about the user experience and while others are okay with light themes,
    other are not.
    We addressed this and added dark theme, which is more 
    friendly to the eyes. <br />
    The toggle button is located on the Top Navigation bar.
    For more detailes, [learn how to change your theme](/getting-started/tutorial#theme)
