## Theme

Since we care about your eyes and all the "All Nighters", we have two themes,
light, to use it in bright environments and dark low lit environments.

By default, the theme is set to System Default (auto).

To change the theme for PC, navigate to the Top Bar on the far right.

For Mobile:

<Steps>

  0. Navigate to the Top Bar.

  1. Click on 
      <div class="w-10">
        <ThemedImageContainer
          dark={AsideButtonDarkMobile}
          light={AsideButtonLightMobile}
          alt="button to open the aside"
          loading="lazy"
        />
      </div>
      to access the Side Navigation Bar.

  2. Scroll to the bottom. You will find a selector to choose your theme.
