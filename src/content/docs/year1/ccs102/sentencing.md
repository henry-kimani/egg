or wrong they committed.

The aim is to balance the scales of justice and provide a sence of closure to
victims and society by ensuring the offenders "pay" for their crimes.

#### Deterrence

It is focused on preventing future criminal behavior, both by the convicted and
others in the society

##### Forms of deterrence

1. **General Deterence**

    It seeks to discourage the broader population from committing crimes by making
    an example of the offender.

2. **Specific Deterence**

    It aims to dissuade the convicted individual from reoffending through punishment.

#### Incapacitation

It involves removing offenders from the society to protect the public from potential
harm. It assumes that society can keep the offender from committing further crime
by detention or execution. This can be achieved through incarceration, probation etc.

#### Types of Incapacitation

1. **Permanent Incapacitation**

    It involves imposing a sentence that removes an offender from the socity for
    a significant portion of their natural life. The goal is to ensure the individual
    will never have the opportunity to commit further crimes in the community.
    For example, life imprisonment or death penalty.

2. **Temporary Incapacitation**

    It involves imposing a sentence that restricts an offender's freedom for a 
    finite period. The intent is to prevent the individual from engaging in
    criminal activity during the specific timeframe.

#### Rehabilitation

It aims to reform and rehabilitate offenders addressing the underlying causes of
criminal behavior. This approach recognizes that some individuals may have factors
like addiction or mental health issues that contribute to their criminal actions.

Rehabilitation seeks to provide education, therapy and support to help them 
reintergrate into society as law-abiding citizens.

#### Restoration

It is associated with restorative justice principles. It focuses on reparing the 
harm caused by the crime to victims, the community and the offender.

The goal is to promote healing and reconcilitation. Offenders are encouraged to 
take responsibility for their actions and actively participate in making ammends
to victims and the community.
