#### The Flow of Decision Making in the Criminal Justice System

Begins when a case has been reported.

    The process beings either when a crime has been reported or when police believe
    a crime has been committed.

2. **Arrest**

    If the police has enough evidence showing that a particular person has 
    committed a crime, the may make an arrest.

3. **Booking**

    Once arrested, you are taken to the police station or post for booking in 
    which a record is made of the arrest.

    - Fingerprints may be taken 
    - Photographs taken
    - Interrogations are taken

    You will be required to stay silent, to avoid self-incremination. Alternatively,
    you may ask to speak to your lawyer.

    They can also bail you out depending on the case.

4. **Charging**

    Prosecutors are the link between the police and courts and they consider the 
    facts on the case and decide whether there is reasonable cause that the crime
    was committed and by the **suspect**.

5. **Arraignment**
    
    The **accused** appears in the court, hears the inductment and enter a plea. They
    may plead guilty or not.

6. **Trial**

    The is the longest stage in the decision making process. This stage begins 
    when the accused pleaded not guilty.

    The **defendant** may be found guilty only if evidence is proved beyond 
    reasonable doubt that they committed the crime.

7. **Sentencing**

    The courts are responsible for imposing sentences. The intent is to make sentences
    suitable to the offender and the offence.

8. **Appeal**

    If the accused is convicted and wished to challenge the verdict, they may
    appeal.

9. **Corrections**

    Corrections involve custodial or non-custodial sentences.
