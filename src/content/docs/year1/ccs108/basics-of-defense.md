#### Layered Security

This involves implementing multiple defensive measures to protect valuable data
and digital assets.

This makes sure that if one layer is exploited, there is a another in place to
mitigate.

- **Level 1:** Access control and Surveillance cameras

- **Level 2:** Network firewalls and intrusion detection, system monitoring 
traffic on organisations networks.

- **Level 3:** Application level protection e.g user auth or advanced threat 
detection software powered by artifical intelligence algorithms.

#### Advantages

1. Redundancy
2. Improved resilence.
3. Better preparedness.
4. Strategic allocation of resources.
5. Enhanced flexibility.
6. Reduced likelyhood of severity of breaches.
7. Comprehensive coverage.
8. Customized security solutions.
9. Regulatory compliance.
10. Competitive edge.

#### Components/ Ways to ensure defense

1. Identifying and mitigating risks
    - Regular risk assessment and vulnerability scans.
    - Implement access control, network segmentation and data encryption.
    - Limit user access priviledges.

2. Physical security measures.
    - Securing physical assets such as buildings, hardware and equipment.
    - Implement biometrics, surveillance camera's and alarms.
    - Layering defense, internal and external.

3. Network and System Security
    - Implement access control and encryption.
    - Utilizing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and firewalls.
    - Layered protection.
    - Regularly updating and patching hardware and software.

4. Application Security
    - Vulnerability assessment, penetration testing and code review.
    - Secure coding practises and regular updates and patching.
    - Adhering to industry standard best practises.

5. Incident Response Plan
    - Steps to take after a security breach or cyber attack.
    - Roles and resp for team members.
    - Regular testing and updating

#### Types of security defense models

1. Prevention: Creating first line of defense e.g firewalls.

2. Detection: Identifying and containing attacks using network system tools like
IDS and SIEM.

3. Response: Quick mitigation of security incidents through incidents response 
plan.

4. Network Defense: Protecting overall network infrastructure through VPN's, IDS
and firewalls.

5. Host Defense: Protecting individual devices throught anti-virus.
