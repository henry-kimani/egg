Access control and intrusion detection is a unified system that allows users to
monitor and control physical access to areas.

Access control is restricting and granting access to specific areas.

Intrusion detection is identification and authorization.

IDS (Intrusion Detection) ensure no violation through:
- Network Oversight
- Host Monitoring
- Anomally Detection
- Signature-Based Detection

In IDS and access control users can control set parameters for authorized access
into both physical and cloud-based locations.

It works by detecting anomalies in cloud and physical spaces by deploying the
following processes:
- Comparing system files against malware
- Scan for malware patterns
- Monitor user for malious intent
- Monitor system settings and configurations to ensure optimization

#### Benefits

1. Optimize your security.
2. Provide access to modular and scalable software that easily intergrates with
third party software to ensure data is fully protected.
3. Flexibility of controls allows users to choose which type of software they
would like to control.
4. Data is backed up in the cloud with guaranteed protection.

### Access Control

It regulates who or what can view resources.

There are two types:

- **Physical** 

    It limits access to physical locations e.g buildings. It uses electronic
    access control systems that rely on user credentials, access control readers
    or auditing.

- **Logical** 

    ensures access control on software e.g connection between two computures on 
    a network. It performs identification, authentication and authorization of
    users using login credentials e.g passwords, biometric scans or MFA(Multi-factor
    authentication).

#### Importance of access control

1. It minimizes the security risk of unauthorized access to physical and logical
systems.

2. It ensures that security technology and access control policies are in place
to protect confidential information.

#### How it works

- It identifies and verifies the person or application and authorizes the level
of access and the set of actions associated with username or ip addresses.

- It uses directory services and protocol including
    - light-weight directory access protocol and
    - security assertion markup language
to authenticate and authorize users and enable them to connect to computer
resources e.g distributed applications and web servers.

#### Types of Access Control

1. **Mandatory access control (MAC):** The access rights are controlled by a central
authority. Often used by government or military environments.

2. **Discretionary access control (DAC):** Owners or admins of protected data,
systems and resources set the policies that define who and what is authorized
to access the resource.

3. **Role-Based access control (RBAC):** It restricts computer resources based on
an individual / group defined business functionality. It relies on a complex
structure developed by role engineering.

4. **Rule-Based access control:** Admins define the rules that govern access to 
resource objects e.g rules based on conditions such as time of day.

5. **Attributed-Based access control:** It manages access rights by evaluating
a set of policies and relationships using attributes of users, systems and
environment conditions.

#### Challenges

1. Dynamically managing distributed IT environments.
2. Password fatigue.
3. Compliance visibility through consistent reporting.
4. Centralizing user directories and avoiding application-specific silos.
5. Data governance and visibility through consistent reporting.

#### Access controls software

1. Reporting and monitoring applications.
2. Passwords management tools.
3. Provisioning tools.
4. Identity repositories
5. Security policy enforcement tools.
