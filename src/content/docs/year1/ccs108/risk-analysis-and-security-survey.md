Risk Analysis: is an assessment process that identifies the potential for any
adverse events taht may negatively affect organizations and the enviroment.

- They help determine whether they should undertake a project or prove a financial
application.

#### Takeaways

1. Risk analysis seeks to identify, measure and mitigate various risk exposures
or hazards they are facing.

2. Quantitative Risk Analysis: Uses mathematical models and simulations to assign
numerical values to riks.

3. Qualitative Risk Analysis: relies on a person's subjective judgement to build
a theoretical model of risk.

#### Understanding

1. Assess an event.
2. Worth of a project.
3. Identify what could go wrong.
4. Estimate the extent of impact.

#### Types of Risk Analysis

1. Risk-benefit Analysis: Just like cost-benefit anaysis, it compares potential 
benefits with associated risks.

2. Needs-assessment Analysis: It involves better understanding a need or a gap

3. Business Impact Anaysis: Wanting to know how a business will impact a business
after seeing its potential risk.

4. Root-cause Anaysis: Done because something is happening that shouldn't and
identifying its impact.

#### Performing a Risk Analysis

##### Step 1: Identify Risks

- Make a list of potential risk, you may encounter.
- Calling different departments for brainstoming.
- Risk Analysis should be more specific trying to address a specific problem.

##### Step 2: Identy Uncertainty

- Most riskest aspects may be undefined.
- Critical, understand how each potential risk has uncertainty.

##### Step 3: Estimate Impact

- Understanding financial impact which is:

    Risk Value = Probability of Event Happening X the Cost of the Event.

    For example, 1% chance of a product defection costing a company 100mil,

    Risk Value = 1mil = 1/100 x 100,000,000

##### Step 4: Build Analysis Model

- Inputs from above are fed to an analysis model which will attempt to yield 
different outcomes, probabilities and financial projections of what may occur.

##### Step 5: Analysis Results

- With the results from the model, management determines the best course of action
by comparing the likelyhood of risk projected, financial impact and model situations.

##### Step 6: Implement Solutions

- After information digestion, the plan is put into action.
- Strategies may include:
    - Doing Nothing
    - Buying Insurance
    - Diversting a product
    - Restricting trade in certain areas.
    - Sharing operation risks with a partner company.

### Quantitative Risk Analysis

- The risk is build using simulation or deterministic statistics to assign numerical
values to risk
- Inputs are mostly assumptions and random variables.
- It generates an outcome, analyzed using graphs, scenario anaysis to make decisions
to mitigate and deal with risk.

### Qualitative Risk Analysis

Involves written definations of the uncertainties and evaluatino of the extent of
the impact and the counter-measures plans.

#### Pros of Risk Analysis

1. Aid in minimizing losses.
2. Allow management to quantify risk ad assign dollars to future events.
3. Protect the company resources, produce better process.

#### Cons of Risk Analysis 

1. Heavily relies on estimates, difficult to perform certain risks.
2. Cannot predict unpredictable, black swan events.
3. May underestimate risk mangnitude or occurance, leading to over confident
operations.

### Security survey as part of risk management

Security Survey is a comprehensive analysis of a company's premises, systems and
procedures.

#### Obectives

1. Measures the current security in place.
2. Identify and quantify any weaknesses in current security plan.
3. Determinig the degree of protection required.
