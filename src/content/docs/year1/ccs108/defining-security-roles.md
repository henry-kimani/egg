Security guards are regard as part of the family. 

Although work defined by management depends on the clients needs, their primary
objective is prevention and detection of crime.

For security guards to work as a team, they need information that other people 
don't have.

guard.

### Diffrence between Police and Security Officer

trouble has already.

Security officers prevent all from happening. They deter crime by their presence.

#### Visibility and Vigilance

Security officers are encouraged to:

1. Be visible. Actively being present is enought to prevent crime e.g verifying
ID's, being at check points.

2. Be vigilant(watchful, alert, wary). Not being vigilant e.g skipping patrols, 
sleeping at work etc, could cause occurrance of crime.

3. Be diligent so that they be effective. This involves working hard with
concentration.

#### Reflexes and Response

1. Security guards should be able to respond immediately on suspicious activities.
2. They should make quick and accurate assessments for best responses.
3. They should follow a chain of command to report either to their manager or supervioser.
4. Sometimes, they can diffuse a situation by making it known.

#### Monitoring and Maintaining Order

depends on policies laid by management but skill knowing who is in the building
by verifying ID's is important.
