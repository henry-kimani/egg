### Murder

Most serios

Most crimes in england were felonies and felonies called for each - , however,
the common law recognized some killings resulted in intentional act that took
place without -, therefore in order to punish with something less primitive than
execution and crime, manslaughter was born.

Manslaughter was kiling of a human being without malice.

#### General elements of Homocide

Homocide decribes all the unlawful killings of another human being.

This catergory includes:
- Murder
- Manslaughter
- Negligence homicide

All murders are homicide thought not all homicides are murders.

It is purposive, knowing, recklessness and negligence causing the death of another
human being.

##### Actus Reus of Homicide

Causing the death of another human being, however, 
- when a person is alive?
- when a person is dead?

To be charged, the presumed victim must be alive to being with.

If the victim is dead, the defendant's actions wouldn't be homicide but attempted
homicide.

There are two ways to measure if a person is dead:
1. If the heart stopped beating.
2. Measurement of brain activity, activity to support to life.

Acting intentionally or purposively. Engaged in an action with and end purpose.

Recklessness is when a person takes a substancial and unjustified risk. They
engage in behavior an average person could not participate in.

Comparing recklessness and negligence, recklessness implies a greater degree.

People act in recklessness when they act rushly in situations they are aware of 
consequences.

Negligence exists in situations were a person conducts depart from that of a 
reasonable person. Such people lack awareness of risk in their behavior either
through carelessness.

##### Concurrence

The point at which wrongful act and intent intersect. If either is missing, crime
is considered to have not occured.

##### Causation

There must be a causual link between mental state of the killer, the wrongful
act and the harm.

Conduct is a cause of a result when its a pre-cursor but for which the result in
question has not occured.

The relationship between conduct and resutls satisfy any additional causal 
requirement by the law defining the offense.

Some of the requirements of causation are
1. Actual / Factual Causation
2. Legal Causation ? Proximate

This distiguishes homicide from many other types of crime which are conduct
crime which don't require additional resulting harm.

carefully).

of time to formulate a plan and carry out the act.

which could be murder, but committed under influence of extreme mental or
emotional disturbance for which there are reasonable explanantion / excuses.
