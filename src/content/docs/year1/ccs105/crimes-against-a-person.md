### Murder

Most serios

Most crimes in england were felonies and felonies called for each - , however,
the common law recognized some killings resulted in intentional act that took
place without -, therefore in order to punish with something less primitive than
execution and crime, manslaughter was born.

Manslaughter was kiling of a human being without malice.

#### General elements of Homocide

Homocide decribes all the unlawful killings of another human being.

This catergory includes:
- Murder
- Manslaughter
- Negligence homicide

All murders are homicide thought not all homicides are murders.

It is purposive, knowing, recklessness and negligence causing the death of another
human being.

##### Actus Reus of Homicide

Causing the death of another human being, however, 
- when a person is alive?
- when a person is dead?

To be charged, the presumed victim must be alive to being with.

If the victim is dead, the defendant's actions wouldn't be homicide but attempted
homicide.

There are two ways to measure if a person is dead:
1. If the heart stopped beating.
2. Measurement of brain activity, activity to support to life.

##### Mens Rea

Acting intentionally or purposively. Engaged in an action with and end purpose.

Recklessness is when a person takes a substancial and unjustified risk. They
engage in behavior an average person could not participate in.

Comparing recklessness and negligence, recklessness implies a greater degree.

People act in recklessness when they act rushly in situations they are aware of 
consequences.

Negligence exists in situations were a person conducts depart from that of a 
reasonable person. Such people lack awareness of risk in their behavior either
through carelessness.

##### Concurrence

The point at which wrongful act and intent intersect. If either is missing, crime
is considered to have not occured.

##### Causation

There must be a causual link between mental state of the killer, the wrongful
act and the harm.

Conduct is a cause of a result when its a pre-cursor but for which the result in
question has not occured.

The relationship between conduct and resutls satisfy any additional causal 
requirement by the law defining the offense.

Some of the requirements of causation are
1. Actual / Factual Causation
2. Legal Causation ? Proximate

##### Result

This distiguishes homicide from many other types of crime which are conduct
crime which don't require additional resulting harm.

#### Degrees of homicide

They are classified as first, second and third degree homicide.

##### First degree

It is the premeditated and deliberate killing of another(cold killing and considered
carefully).

Premeditated implies, the person who committed the killing had sufficient amount
of time to formulate a plan and carry out the act.

Time for planning may be minutes, days or weeks.

Deliberate => quality 

Premeditated => quantity

Deliberate killing could occur with premeditation, but vice versa cannot.

##### Second Degree

Intentional killing of another in circumstances less calbardor than first degree.

It is deliberate and unlawful but lacks the plan.

### Manslaughter

Manslaughter is the killing in the heat of passion or commited reckless or one
which could be murder, but committed under influence of extreme mental or
emotional disturbance for which there are reasonable explanantion / excuses.

**Voluntary Manslaughter** takes place when a person has been killed intentionally
but without malice aforethought causing the accused to act in the heat of passion
leading to use of deadly force.

Heat of passion is an irresistable emotion which a reasonable person could not
experience under same circumstances and facts.

The **mens rea** is in manslaughter is intent to cause death of another in the 
heat of passion caused by adequate provocation and without lawful period.


### Sexual Offenses

#### Rape

Intentional and unlawful act that causes peneration with his or her genital organs
without consent or the consent is obtained by force or by means of threat, that
person is guilty of an offense and is eligible for life imprisonment term not
less than 10 yrs to life.

In common law, rape means kernal knowledge(sexual penetration) of a woman who 
is not your wife using force without consent.

Other types of penetration (anus, bu objects), didn't fulfil this requirement.
This was treat as a sodomy laws.

Since liqucid act is penal to vaginal penetration, the defendant must be a male.

To prove common law rape, force must include:
1. Extrincisic force
2. Intrincisic force

The state must prove the defendant used more force that is necessary. However, 
today instrinsic force, the minimal threshold is force used in penetration, must
be proven. Additionally, the state must prove 'no consent' from the victim.

At common law to prove no consent required the victim to resist the defendant.

##### Martial Rape Exception

This exception removes criminal liability on the husband for forcing sexual
penetration against will. Essentially, in common law the husband could not be 
charged for raping his wife.

Some of the reasons include:
- Women were viewed a property transfered from the father to the husband, so the
husband had the sole voice on the property.
- The wife was assumed automatic content to sex.
- Marriage and what happens in common law was considered a personal issue which
was not acceptable for state of intervention.

##### Improvements

Other penerations were considered unlawful and fitted under the definition of 
sexual assault e.g peneration of an object or finger.

Because of this boarder definition of illegal act, there are no gender limitation
of both defendant or victim.

Consent is very difficult to prove in state.

##### Mordern law of rape

- Rape does not require penal penetration.
- Penetration of any sexual part e.g penis, finger.
- The defendant no longer required to be a man.
- The standard of additional force by the accused has been replaced by instrinsic
force standard.
- If a victim is impaired or mentally impotent, the prof of force is unnecessary.
- Martial relationship between the two is irrelevant as women are not their
husband's property rather citizens. However, some jurisdictions have martial
rape allowance mitigating level of rape.

**Actus Reus**: Sexual penetration by force of threat of a person without consent.

**Mens Rea**: Intent / Purpose

#### Attempted Rape

Attempting unlawful and intentional commit an act of peneration with his or her
genital organs is guilty of an offense not less than 5 yrs to life.

#### Sexual Assault

Penetrates their genital organs of another with
- another or that person body part.
- an objected is manipulated by another or that person.

Manipulates part of his/her body or another to cause peneration of another's 
organs.

Imprisonment is not less than 10 yrs.

#### Compelled or induced indecent acts

#### Indecent act on family view

They are acts that cause penetration on indecent acts committed within the view
of a family member, child or person with mental disabilities.

Imprisonment is not less than 10yrs.

#### Defilement

Acts of penetration with a child.
- < 11yrs = life imporsonment
- 12 - 15 yrs = not less than 20yrs
- 16-18 yrs = not less than 15yrs

It is a defense of charge if the child deceived the accused thinking they were
over age and the accused reasonably believed they were over 18yrs.

The belief is determined having regards to all circumstances include steps the 
accused took to ascertain age of the child.

When a person is charged with the offense of act 15 < 18 yrs, the court upon 
conviction sentence the accused in accordance to the Borstal Institution Act
and the Children's Act.

The above arguments don't apply if the child is within prohibited degrees of blood
affinity.

#### Attempted Defilement

Attempting to commit acts of penetration with a child.

Imprisonment is not less than 10 yrs.

The provocations of section 8 (5)(6)(7)(8) shall apply mutatis mutandis to this
section.
