#### Types of Actus Reus

1. **Voluntary Act**

    An act must have a voluntary meaning, an individual had control over their 
    actions.

2. **Omission**

    In some cases individuals have a duty to act and failing to act may lead to a 
    criminal liability. Or failing to act when legally required to, resulting in
    criminal liability.

    Omission is considered actus reus when the defendant:
    - has a legal duty to act
    - knowledge of the facts necessitating actions (why it is necessary to act).
    - the ability to person the required action

    Examples:
    1. Failing to provide care or food for a dependant person.
    2. Neglecting to report a serious crime required by law.

3. **Consequences or results**

    The act must lead to a prohibited outcome.

    The defendants mere presence is enough to proved actus reus. For example,
    - being present in prohibited areas,
    - possesing illegal drugs/firearms,
    - operating a business without proper

For actus reus to be established, causation and social harm for proving defendants
actions warrant criminal liability.

### Causation

Causation aims to establish a link between the defendants actions and the harmful
result.

How the defendant's acts caused the criminal outcome.

##### Rule of Causation

Before an accused can be held guilty or accountable of an offense, it must be
established that they caused or is responsible of the actus reus of that 
offense.

#### Types of Causation

1. **Factual Causation**

    It involves determining whether the harm would have occurred 'but for' (were
    it not for) the defendants actions.

2. **Legal Causation**

    Fixes some of the absurdities that may arise following crime following the 
    application of the factual causation.

    It states the acts of the accused be an operative and substancial cause of 
    prohibited event. The accused acts were the sole cause of the harm meaning
    their acts must not be trivial.

    Often it is expressed if the prohibited event is a foreseable consequence
    of the accused acts e.g if it was fit predicatable.
