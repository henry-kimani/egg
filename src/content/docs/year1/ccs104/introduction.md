**Language** is the primary language of communication and defines humanity.

Its made up of several elements:
- Sound
- Grammar
- Vocuburary

Most people have gone with mechanisms that make them to make speech signals.

**Grammar** is a set or rules that governed how sounds are joined into sentences,
phrases and clauses.

Language enables people to communicate their ideas, feelings and attitude.

Its essential / important in every aspect and interaction in our everyday life.

We use language to inform those around us what we feel and desire.

Also we use it to question the world around us.

Language is also at the heart of a culture. Its a fundamental attribute of cultures
and individuals as they are able to identify themselves with community.

Language, however, is also used to commit crime and therefore destroy peaceful
co-existence among people.

**Crime** is defined as an illegal act, punishable by law. If a person commits a crime
and is detected, they could be arrested, charged and prosecuted. If found guilty,
they will receive a sentence e.g community service, fine, imprisonment.

**Deviance** is behavior that does not conform to a society&apos;s norms and values.
If a person behaves as a deviant, it could lead to negative sanctions e.g ignored,
killed or told off.

Some but not all deviant acts are illegal.

Many sociologists argue that when crime involves legally defined behavior,
deviance is socially defined.
