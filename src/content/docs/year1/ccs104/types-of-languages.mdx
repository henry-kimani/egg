### Criminal Speech Acts

Some wrongful acts are committed by speech or writing.

Language crimes are illegal speech acts.

Speech acts involves using language to perform certain types of actions e.g
promising, questioning, threatening, lying, soliciting and agreeing.

Some speech acts, characterized by:

1. **Illucitionary force** 

    Intent of the actor. For example, one has to have intented to solicit a crime 
    in order to guilty of solicitation.

2. **Perlocutionary effect**

    The effect that does not leave the receiver. Feeling intimidated is not a
    threat, whatever the intent.

Other aspects of speech acts, are that they are **performatives**. Just saying it,
is to do it e.g *a mother says to a child, "I don't have time today, I promise 
to fix your bicycle tomorrow.*

In this speech act of promising, its not performative because the mother did not
fix the bicycle by saying it unless she has magical powers. Here fix describes
the action, but cannot perform them.

Some speech acts are performative e.g agreeing to commit an illegal act or asking
someone else to commit one. Others like lying under oath are not.

However, people engage in performative speech acts using verbs like ask, order, 
promise. Though its also common to engage in performative speech acts without
announcing so explicity e.g *"I will fix your bicycle tomorrow" you can count on
it.* She made te promise without using the world explicity.

The second aspect, speech act including illegal one can be accomplished indirectly.
I can threaten you without using "threaten". Its just using an intimidating 
statement.

### Solicitation

This is the act of asking or inducing someone to commit a crime.

Ussually, the government need only to prove that the solicitor intented the crime
to be committed.

It is often performed by the speech of requesting, however, it can be done through
a question and does not require the word "request".

For example, 
> *I request you to kill my boss,
please kill my boss,
I want you to kill my boss,
would you please kill my boss?.*

Note also, that some forms of solicitation refer to the intent to the actor, in
this case intent to kill i.e the illucitionary force of the act (solicit, endeviours,
persuade), while others (induces), require the solicited party actually be conviced
to commit.

Though linguists and philosophers of language generally that objective sincerity
is not required to perform a speech act successfully. (Searle 1969).

#### Examples of Solicitation

The issue revolves around what type of speech act the defendant made:

1. Sheik accused of soliciting the murder Mubarek, the President of Egypt and 
was later convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for this and related
offenses. The evidence (recorded conversations) clearly stated Sheik was requesting
or urging his followers to assasinate President Mubarek. *"should make up with
God ... by turning his rifle's barrel to President Mubarek&apos;s chest and kill
him."*

2. Often people don't solicit crime directly. Consider a case of a Colorado man
named Hood who decided to rid himself off his wife. He called his friend Maher
to discuss his marital state. He shared the plan to him of planning a robbery
during which his wife would be killed, but he needed a third person to pull
the trigger. Maher advised Hood to seek psychological advice, to which Hood 
responded "No, she needs to die." Maher testified Hood did sincerely want his 
wife dead but didn&apos;t request him directly. But during their conversation, 
Hood was only with Maher and when he said he need a third person to pull the trigger,
he ment Maher.

3. World Church of Creator and Church of Creator trademark infriengment. Hale
agrees with the surbordinate's suggestion to kill the jury. Hale approved indirectly
of the hatched plan thinking it wouldn't get him in trouble. But he was wrong
and was later convicted.

    When an individual has sufficient authority to ensure an illegal act does
    not occur, his approval of it becomes legally tantamount (equivalent to) to
    his requesting (or ordering) the act, albeit and indirect one. In this case
    Hale had sufficient authority to ensure that the killing of the jury not to
    occur, however, his indirect approval is equivalent to him requesting/
    ordering it.

4. Not only must the solicitor request someone to commit a crime, but the request
must be sincere.

### Conspiracy

Involves two or more people agreeing to commit a crime.

An explicit agreement is rare, though tatic agreement is sufficient meaning it
can be proven by circumstantial evidence.

Many jurisdications require the agreement be backed up with an **overt act** 
because often evidence is indirect.

An overt act is an act done openly and which the criminal intention of the act
is very clear.

Often time some linguistic cues such as "we" are used. For instance, the pronoun
"we" used to establish conspiracy by people avoiding to pay tax to the federal
income taxes. The participant allegedly sold property to each other by cash, to
conceal the transations from the tax authorities. A statement from one of the
participants tapped by an informant was that "we don't want check writings between
us. If we are caught by the IRS, we are dead."

Other criminal activities employ street slang and coded language aware that the
law enforcement might be eaves dropping. Conspiracy to sell drugs using longs, 
shorts and apples language. The judge permit expert testimony by narcortics
investigators to define such street talk.

Using such language might bring problems with linguistics association. If ears
of a jury hear you talk like a drug dealer you must be one.

### Bribery

Involves giving someone an **item of value** with the intent ot induce that person
to act in a particular way in their official or professional capcity.

Also the item must be "corruptly" offered or received for the purpose of influencing
official action.


The receipient of the bribe must belong to a specified class of people typically
government officials or court witnesses.

However, it can be accomplished by using words. Instead of giving something of 
value, you might offer to give something of value.

There are at least three different speech acts that can be involved in bribing:
offering, requesting  and agreeing.

Also, in some occurence bribery is indirect. Words such as "take care of him" or
"make a gesture" has been held to constitute a request for a bribe.

### Threatening

A threat is an expression of intent to injure of punish.

Threats are also involved in other crimes:

1. **Extortion**

    To take or seize from an unwilling person by force or threats.

2. **Blackmail**

    Whereby the victim consents to give money or property to someone but only
    because of a threat to do something bad to the victim if he doesn't consent.
    However, the threat may be the blackmailer, if not paid by the victim, will
    reveal something that is perfectly legal to reveal in any event.

#### The speech act of threatening

1. The are similar to warnings and preditions since they deal with events or state
of affairs that are likely to happen in the future. The difference in threats is
the speaker implies or expresses the intention to bring about the event.

2. The second requirement, the speaker must believe that the future event or state
of affair will be bad for the addressee. The typical difference between threats
and warnings is, warnings are ment to protect someone from potential harm. But
some warnings can be threats. If I "warn" someone against a harm that I intent to
cause myself, it is ussually a threat. Even the word "promise" in some 
circumstances can be a threat.

3. Third requirement, the speaker must intend his utterance or statement to
intimidate the addressee. Consider Watts V. United States. During the anti-war
rally, a young man stated to a group, if he was forced to carry a rifle in
Vietnam, "the first person I would get my sights on, would be President Johnson".
The supreme court, not given a "time threat." If he parading outside the white
house with a loaded rifle, it would be almost certainly be a threat.

4. Final requirement, a threat must appear sincere. The speaker does not have
to be sincere. To be exact, the speaker must intend the addressee to believe that
the speaker intends to carry out the threated act. A contrast, a boss told his
employee, "I should just shoot you" this is a joke. If a robber comes to you in
a dark alley, askes for you wallet or he will kill you, this is a threat.

#### Indirect threats

Threats can also be made indirectly or non-verbally. As long as the requirements
are met. For example, a defendant made a hand gesture in the shape of a gun to 
the prosecution witness entering the court room. The gestural forms show an act
that would be bad for the addressee and the act intimidates them.

Even when expressed verbally, threats are frequently indirect e.g suppose involved
to a crime tells the witness, if they say anything to the police "something is 
going to happen to them."

Also by means of questions. A woman was being harassed by a man and she reported
the activities to the police. A month later, the man called the woman and told 
he ahd been told to pay a fine and continued by asking "What should I do to 
retaliate?" Beside being a mere question, note the man does intend to retaliate
and communication such intentions to the victim can be considered a threat.

### Perjury

Perjury involves lying under oath or which is commonly know as a false statement.

Perjury also requries that the false statement be material. If it relates to a
minor matter (something that would be not expected to influence a trial or other
official proceedings) it does not constitute to perjury.

Under the US Federal Law, a person commits perjury if he "wilfully and contary
to such oaths states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe
to be true."

To determine whether a statement is false, we need to determine its meaning.
In perjury cases, judges take a relative literal approach to interpretation.

#### The Bronston Case and Literal Truth

The issue in Bronston was "whether a witness may be convicted for perjury for an
answer under oath, that is literally true but not responsive to the question asked
and argubly misleading by negative implication."

<Aside type="tip" title="Example">
  Samuel Bronston was a president of a movie production company and had petitioned
  for bankcruptcy. At the hearing the laywers were allowed to question him regarding
  this assets.

  - *Do you have any bank accounts in Swiss banks, Mr Bronston?*
  - *No, sir.*
  - *Have you ever?*
  - *The company had a account there about six months, in Zurich?*

  In fact he had a large personal bank account in Swizerland where 5 years 
  periodically had deposited $180,000.
</Aside>

Bronston was convicted of perjury. The prosecution apparently conviced the jury
that although the second statement was true, if falsely implied, he had never
had a personal Swiss bank account.

The court emphasized that the perjury statute refers to what the witness "states"
not what he "implies". Since Bronston never said directly he never had a personal
accoutn in Switzerland.

It is the work of the examining lawyer to clarify the vague ambigious answer of
literal truth but unresponsive answer, where by the solution is follow up with
more precise questions, not to initiate perjury.

Its unfortunately not easy to determine the truthyness to the an answer as it
depends on the context asked.

Peter asked Larry the amount of money to know if he can buy a soda can. Larry 
replied he had 1 dollar. This answer of Larry is true and helpful, however, Peter asked
the amount to see if Larry has the amount to lent him i.e $20, Larry's answer is
false. <br />
We read relevance into the answers and judge its honesty accordingly.

The bronston case created what is now often called literal truth defense, often
used by defendants accused of perjury.

During perjury cases there tend to be rise of ambiguities, where by ther are 
different interpretations to the question. Considering the Bronston case, the 
Supreme Court assumed that the lawyer's question ment personal accounts, suppose
it instead refered to any bank account, personal or business. In that case
Bronston's answer would be true but incomplete which would lead to false 
inference (to introduce something as a resoned conclusion).

#### Perjury and Intended Meaning

Many perjury cases involves questions of meaning.

Though linguists and philosophers have identified various types of meanings what
metters most is how the defendant intended an utterance to be understand.

If he intended his testimony to be understood in a way consistent with the facts
that he believed to be true, his testimony should not be subject to him to
criminal liability.

If there is a deviation between his testimony and his understanding of the 
truth, it was material and intention should be guilty of verdict.

Thus defendants commonly argue that:

1. Allegedly false testimony was not material.

2. That a discrepancy was unintentional.

3. Their testimony does not contain a false statement.

Typically the prosecutor's will mean something different with the defendant.

#### The Bottom Line

Witness should always say the truth or the Criminal Justice System would fall. If
they fail to tell the truth and make a fasle statement on the material issue, they
should be subject to prosecution.

However, its not always easy to determine what witnesses mean in response to
queries by lawyers.

Too often lawyers and prosecutors manipulate the examination of witnesses to 
suit their own trial strategies.
