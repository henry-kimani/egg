#### Definitions

Sociology is the scientific and systematic study of groups and group interactions,
societies and social interactions, from small and personal groups to very large
groups.

Society is a group of people who live in a defined geographical area, who interact
with one another and who share a common culture.

Sociological imagination ( C. Wright Mills ) is the awareness of the relationship
between a person's behaviour and experiences, and the wider culture that shaped
the person's choices and perceptions.

#### Studing patterns

Culture patterns, social forces and influences put pressure on people to select
one choice over another.

Sociologists try to identify these general patterns by examing the behavior of
large group of people living in the same society and experiencing the same
societal pressures.

#### Studing part and whole

An individual and society are inseparable.

Figuration is the process of simultaneously analyzing the behavior of individuals
and the society that shapes that behavior.

## History / Evolution / Development of Sociology

### Auguste Comte ( 1978 - 1857 )

The term "sociology" was first coined by a french essaiyst, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyes
(1748 - 1836) in unpublished manuscripts. In 1838, Comte reinvented it.

Comte studied engineering but became a pupil of social phylosopher Claude Henri
de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon (1760 - 1825).

Social scientist could use same scientific methods utilized in natural sciences.

Comte belived that social scientists should work to better the society and once
scholars identified laws that governed society, they could adress poor education
and poverty.

Comte proposition of social evolution state society undergoes three phases in its
quest for the truth according.

1. **Theological Stage**

    The stage relies on supernatural or religious explanations of the phenomena of 
    human behavior. This is when humans turn to supernatural ages as the cause of 
    all phenomena.

2. **Metaphysical or Abstract Stage**

    This stage was least important and only ment to be a transitional stage where 
    there is belie that abstract forces control the behavior of human beings.

3. **Positive Stage**

    This stage turned towards discovering through reasoning and observation. Comte 
    being a positivist believed in the natural not supernatural, claming this period
    1800's, the positivist state.

### Herbert Spenser (1820 - 1903)

He was the first to publish a book with "sociology" in it. He rejected Comte's and
Marx's theories. He favoured a form of government that allowed marktet forces to 
control capitalism. His work influenced sociologists such as Emile Durkheim 
(1858 - 1917).

- He is considered the second father of sociology.
- Coined the term survial for the fittest.
- Thought helping the poor was wrong.
- Disagreed's sharply with comte's idea that sociologists should guide social reform.
- Believed in lower and upper social reform.

### Emile Durkheim

Helped establish sociology as a formal academic by establishing the first european
department of sociology at the university of Bordeaux in 1895.

His theory laid out how society transformed from a primitive state into a capitalist,
industrial society.

Belived through studing objective "social facts" it would be possible to determine 
if a society was "healthy" - stable - or "pathological" - experienced a breakdown
in social norms between individual society.

Attempting to prove his work he published a work titled suicide. He examined 
suicide statistics in different police districts to research difference between
catholic and protestant communities.

#### The study of suicide by Emile Durkheim

In conclusion, suicide can have origins in social causes rather than just being 
due to individual temperament.

##### Social intergation and sucide

The more socially intergrated and connected a person is, the less likely they
commit suicide. As social intergration decreases, people are more likey to 
commit suicide.

##### Overview of Durkheim Text
 
Durkheim examined how suicide rates at the time differed across religions.
Specifically, Catholics sucide and protestants, and concluded, catholics
suicide rates were lower due to stronger forms fo social control and cohesion
among them compared to protestants.

##### Demographic of suicide study finding

Durkheim found that suicide was:
- Less common among women than men.
- More common among those single people than among those who are romantically
partned.
- Less common among those who have children.
-Soilders commit suicide more often than civilians.
- Rates of suicide are higher that during peacetimes than they are during wars.

##### Correlation vs Causation: Suicide's Driving forces

- Suicide can not only be caused by psychological or emotional factors but also
social factors, social intergration being a factor.
- The more socially intergrated a person is, the more they are connected to
society, possessing a feeling a general belonging and a sense that life makes
sense within the social context, the less likely there are to commit suicide.
- As social intergration decreases, people are more likely to commit suicide.

##### Durkheim Topology of Suicide

To explain the differing effects of social factors and how they might lead to 
suicide:

1. **Anomic Suicide**
    
    A person experiencing anomie, a sence of not belonging in the society and a
    feeling of not belonging resulting from weakened social cohesion. This period
    occurs when there is social, economic or political upheaval resulting in 
    quick and extreme changes to society and everyday life. Under this circumstances,
    a person might feel so confused and disconnected that they choose to commit 
    suicide.

2. **Altruistic Suicide**

    Often a result of excessive regulation of individual by social factors. A
    person may be moved to kill themselves for a cause or for a society at large.
    For example, someone who commits suicide for the sake of religious or 
    political cause such as the infamous Japanese Kamikaze pilots of World War 2.

3. **Egoistic Suicide**

    Prefound response executed by people who feel totally detached from society.
    Ordinarilly, people are intergrated into society by work roles, ties to 
    family and community and other social bonds. When these bonds are weakened
    through retirement or family loss and friends, likelyhood of egoistic
    suicide increases. Common among elderely people.

4. **Fatalistic Suicide**
    
    Occurs under conditions of extreme social regulation resulting in oppressive
    conditions and denial of self and of agency. The person elects to die rather
    than endure the oppressive conditions. For example, prisoners.

### Karl Marx (1818 - 1893)

German philosopher and economist. He and Friedrich Engels (1820 - 1895) coauthored
the Communist Manifesto. He proposed Marx's theory of society which differed from
Comte's proposal.

Marx rejected comte's positivism and believed society grew and changed as a result 
of the struggles of different social classes over the means of production. As
he developed his theories, indstrial revolution and the rise of capitalism lead
to disparties in the wealth between the owners of the factories and workers.

Capitalism, an economic system characterised by private or corporate ownership of 
goods and the means to produce them grow in many nations.

Marx predicted that inequalities of capitalism would become so extreme that workers
would eventually revolt, leading to communism replacing capitalism.

Communism, an economic system under which there is no private or cooperate
ownership; everything is owned communally and distributed as needed.

Max belived that communism was a more equitable system than capitalism.

### Max Weber (1864 - 1920)

Established a sociology department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilians University
of Munich 1919. Also, wrote on many topics related to sociology including political
change in Russia and social forces that affect factory workers.

Weber claimed there are four main classes: the upper class, white-collar workers,
petite bourgeoisie and manual working class. These effectively parallel the class
structure used in many sociologists.

Weber treated the three sources of social economic status: class, status and
power as seperate but interconnected, each differing from that of Marx, who saw
class as definitive factor in stratification.

Weber differentiates these groups in terms of their economic position. Also 
people varying degree of class, status and power.

Weber believed its difficult or impossible to predict the behavior of groups
using standard scientific methods accurately. They argued the influence of culture
on human behavior had to be taken into account. They applied to researches, how 
their own cultural biases could influence their research.

To deal with this problem, they introduced the concept of verstehem, outside 
observres of social world attempt to understand it from an insiders point of view.
