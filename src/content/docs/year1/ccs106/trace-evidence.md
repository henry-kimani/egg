Trace evidence can be generally interprated as any type of evidence occuring
in small sizes that can be transferred or exchanged between two surfaces without
being noticed.

It is commonly refered to as the mute witness.

When a crime is committed, what ever that was stepped on, touched or was left
could serve as the silent witness against the suspect.

This involve the following

- Finger prints and foot prints.
- Hair
- Clothe fibres
- Blood
- Semen
- Broken glass
- Scratched paint
- Dust and debris

### Approach of trace evidence

When collected carefully, it could be very useful to tell how a crime was committed
and whom.

#### Collection

There are a handful ways of collecting trace evidence.

The evidence is carefully examined, looking at their physical, optical and chemical
properties and compare samples and look at common origins of each other.

#### Techniques of trace evidence collection

##### Handpicking

It involves using sterlized tweezers or forceps to pick up individual pieces of 
trace evidence visible with the naked eye.

- **Advantages**

1. Precise for collecting specific visible evidence.
2. Minimizes disturbance to surrounding areas.

- **Disadvantages**

1. Not suitable for microscopic or less visible evidence.
2. Requires dexterity and control to avoid damaging fragile evidence.

##### Scraping

It involves using a sterile scapel or other blunt instrument to scrape off or use
some sort of friction for adhering to the surface.

- **Advantages**

1. Effective for collecting evidence on rough surfaces.

- **Disadvantages**

1. Can lead to damage the underlying surface if not done carefully.
2. It may mix different types of trace evidence.

##### Swabbing

It involves using a sterile swab, moistened with a suitable solution e.g water,
saline to collect microscopic or loosely attached evidence.

- **Procedure**

    - Investigators don fresh gloves and choose a swab with appropriate material
    (cotton, flocked nylong) depending on the evidence type.
    - They gently roll or dab over the area containing the trace evidence.
    - They swab is air-dried and place in a labbeled container.

- **Advantages**

1. Effective for loosely attached microscopic surfaces.
2. Reduces damage to the underlying surface.

- **Disadvantages**

1. Not suitable for large heavy particles.
2. The collection solution can affect the analysis and the type of evidence.

##### Combing 

It involves using a sterile comb to collect hair or fibre from the surface
such as clothing and carperts.

- **Advantages**

1. Effective for collecting hair or fibre from fabrics.
2. It minimizes damage on underlying surface.

- **Disadvantages**

1. Its not suitable for collecting very short hair fibres.
2. It may mix different types of hair or fibres.

##### Tape Lifting

It involves using a piece of transparent adhesive type to lift trace evidence
from smooth surfaces.

- **Advantages**

1. Effective for collecting evidence on surfaces such as glass.
2. Offers a good visual record of evidence collection and distribution.

- **Disadvantages**

1. It is not suitable for rough or textured surfaces.
2. The adhesive may damage fragile evidence or leave residue on the surface.

##### Vacuuming

It involves using a specialized vaccum cleaner with HEPA filter to collect
evidence from large surfaces, surfaces hard to reach or surfaces difficult to
hand pick.

- **Procedure**

    - Clean the vacuum cleaner.
    - Attach a disposible filter trap.
    - Carefully vacuum ensuring complete coverage.
    - When done, carefully detach the filter.

- **Advantages**

1. Effective for collecting evidence in large amount from large areas or 
difficult-to-reach surfaces.
2. Useful for collecting microscopic loosely attached evidence.

- **Disadvantages**

1. It increases the risk of contaminating the evidence.
2. Its not suitable for fragile evidence.
3. Less precise than other methods.
