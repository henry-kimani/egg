### Introduction

#### Definition of Terms

1. **Juvenile**

    Refers to an age related status that has legal ramifications and is applied 
    to persons who are not yet adults.

2. **Adolescence**

    It is the period between purberty and adulthood in human development commonly
    between the age of 13 - 19.

3. **Juvenile Delinquent**

    A person under the age of 18, who is determined to have broken the law or 
    committed a status offense.

4. **Juvenile Delinquency**

    The anti-social criminal behavior committed by person under the age of 18.
    Juvenile delinquency or simply called delinquency, is the child and adolescent
    version of crime.

5. **Status Offenses**

    They are behaviors that are considered inappropriate or unhealth for children
    and adolescents and the behavior is forbidden because of their age. If committed
    by an adult, they are not Illegal

    For example, smoking, drinking or possessing alcohol, truancy, nonattendance
    at school or violating curfew.

6. **Delinquent Offenses**

    They are violations of legal statutes that also apply to adults in the criminal
    justice system.

7. **Parens Patriae**

    The philosophy that the government is the ultimate guardian of all children
    or disabled adults. It regards the government as the legal protector of 
    citizens unable to protect themselves.

#### Importance of Studing Juvenile Delinquency

1. Children and adolescents commit a significant amount of crime resulting to
victimization hence they are arrest for delinquent acts.

2. Since juvenile delinquency is an indicator for general health and prosperity 
of a society, with high levels of delinquency, its seen as a large part of
social problems. It is troubling because of the victimizations that are inflicted
and the image of the society as unable to control and supervise young people.

3. Juvenile delinquency has different meanings depending of the severity. To many
young people, its a normal face of growing up while to a small group, as a stage
of what will become a lifetime of anti-social behavior.

#### Why is justice administered differently for juveniles in the criminal justice system

1. **Developmental Differences**

    - Cognitive Development: Children's brains are not fully development, 
    especially parts responsible for decision making, impuse control and 
    understanding consequences. This makes them less culpable for their actions 
    compared to adults.

    - Emotional Maturity: Chidren and adolescents are less emotionally mature,
    more prone to peer pressure and more likely to engage in risk behavior without
    fully considering the potential consequences.

2. **Potential Rehabilitation**

    - Plasticity of Behavior: Children have a potential to change and rehabilitate.
    Early intervention can help them develop into responsible adults, while 
    punitive measures might increase the likelyhood of reoffending.

3. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**

    - Best of Interest of the Chid: Legal systems operate on the priniciple that
    decisions should be made in the best interest of the chlid by providing an
    environment that supports their growth and well-being.

    - Protection from Harm: Children should protected from harm of incarceration 
    from adults, such exposure to violence, abuse and negative influences.

4. **Social and Cultural Factors**

    - Role of Family and Community: Children are an intergral part of the community
    and efforts should be made to keep them connected and supported rather than
    isolated in adult correctional facilities.

    - Public Perception and Policy: Society views children as deserving protection
    and second chances. This influences policies and laws designed to provide
    more lenient and rehabilitative responses to juvenile delinquency.

5. **Legal Frameworks and Precedents**

    - International Conventions: Such as United Nations Conventions, emphasize the
    need for special protection and consideration for minors in the criminal justice
    system.
    - Juvenile Justice System: Many countries have distinct procedures and facilities
    tailored to young offenders, focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.

### Theoretical Explanations

#### Freedom (Classical School) and Determinism (Positivist School)

Criminalogical theories views a human subject (the offender in this case), at one extreme
end, as active agents who create and shape their world and bear responsibility
of their choices and decisions they make.

On the other end, passive subjects whose behavior is shaped by a variety of forces
largely beyond their control (Henry and Milovanovic, 1996).

These extreme positions are characterized in as 'freedom and determinism' and
in criminology as classical and positivist school respectively.

#### Freedom (Classical School)

The classical tradition(Beccaria, 1963) is founded on the view, the offender is a
rational actor and emphasizes the role of free will in dictating behavior
(including offending).

Offending behavior is a result of application of choice on the part of the
individiual, specifically, a calculation of the costs and benefits of a particular
course of action.

Offending, in common with other form of human behavior, is motivated by their 
desire to seek pleasure and enjoyment and to avoid pain.

As a rational actor, free to choose their course of action in any given situation,
the offender bears full responsibility for his or her behavior.


#### Determinism (Positivist School)

In contrast positivism - in its **extreme manifestation** - view the offender as a
'puppet' or entirely a passive victim of external or internal forces. When viewed
in this way, the offender tends to bear little to no responsibility of his or
her actions hence he ought to be 'treated' or 'helped', much like someone suffering
from a physical illness, in an attempt to remove the causes of this offending.

In **less extreme** version, the offenders' behavior is not entirely determined,
however, their ability to exercise free will is likely restrained by factors not
entirely within their control (e.g age, poverty or mental illness). In this
scenario, offenders bear some responsibility for their offending, they can claim
some mitigation for their behavior and might be possible to prevent reoffending
if the factors that led them are tackled or confronted.

Thus positivism recommends interventions aimed at changing people and/or their
social/environmental cirmustances. It also recommends expert intervention involving
diagnosis - identification of the causes of offending - and their subsequent
removal.

They are three main types of positivist explanations that will be discussed on 
the next topic.
