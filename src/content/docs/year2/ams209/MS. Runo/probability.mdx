Probability is the numerical measure of chance.

## Definition of terms

##### Range probability

P(A) - Probability an event will happen <br />
P(A') - Probability an event will not happen<br />
P(A') = 1 - P(A)<br />
P(A) + P(A') = 1<br />

##### Probability Space:
A list of all possible outcomes.

## Experimental Probability

Experimental probability is determined by experience or experiment.

The experiment is what is done or observed.

Each coin toss is called a trial and each trial has an outcome.

It is called experiment or experience because we observe what we have done in 
the past.

It is given by

<SimpleLatex formula="\frac{\text{number of favourable outcomes}}{\text{total n.o of trials}}" />

### Examples

  <Aside type="tip" title="Example">

    A boy had a fair die with faces marked 1 - 6. He threw his die up 50 times and
    each time he recorded the number of top faces. The result of his experiment is
    as shown below.

    | face | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
    |------|---|---|---|---|---|---|
    |n.o of times a face has shown up| 11 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 9 | 8 |

    <br />
    What is the probability of getting:

    a. 1 <br />
    $$P(1) = \frac{11}{50}$$

    b. 6 <br />
      $$P(6) = \frac{8}{50}$$

      From past records out of 10 matches, a school football team has played, it has
      won seven. How many matches would they win in the next 30 matches.

      $$P(winning a match) = \frac{7}{10}$$ <br />
      $$\text{in 30 matches} = \frac{7}{10} \times 30$$ <br />
      $$=21 \text{matches}$$ <br />

## Theoretical Probability

It can be calculated without any past experience of the events, unlike experimental
probability.

It is calculated by:

<SimpleLatex formula="=\frac{\text{n.o of favourable outcomes}}{\text{total number of outcomes}}" />

    <Aside title="Example" type="tip">
      A basket contains 5 red balls, 4 green balls and 3 blue balls. If a ball is picked
      at random from the basket, find:

      a. The probability of picking a blue ball.

      $$P(Blue) = \frac{3}{5+4+3}$$ <br />
      $$\frac{3}{12}$$

      b. The probability of not picking a red ball.

      $$P(Red') = 1 - P(Red)$$ <br />
      $$= 1 - \frac{5}{12}$$ <br />
      $$= \frac{7}{12}$$ <br />

      A bag contains 6 black balls and some brown ones. If a ball is picked at random 
      and the probability of picking a black ball is 0.25, find the number of brown 
      balls.

      $$P(Brown) = 1 - P(Black)$$
      $$P(Brown) = 0.75$$

      $$0.25=6$$
      $$0.75=?$$
      $$\frac{6\times0.75}{0.25}$$
      $$=19 brown balls$$

When all possible outcomes are countable, they are said to be discrete.

## Types of Probability

### Combined Probability

It is the probability of two or more events occuring.

### Mutually Exclusive Events

It mutually exclusive events:
- Occurance of one excludes the occurance of the other.
- Occurance of one event depends on the occurance of the other.

If A and B are mutually exclusive events

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)

[or]: we add

<Aside type="tip" title="Example">

If a coin is tossed, probability of getting a head or a tails is:

$$\text{the occurance of one outcome excludes the other hence we add}$$
P(H or T) = P(H) + P(T)
$$=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$$
$$=1$$

</Aside>

### Independent Events

Two events A and B are independent if, the occurance of one does **not influence**
the other.

The probability of them occuring is given by the product of their individual 
probabilities.

$$P(A\;and\;B) = P(A) \times P(B)$$

[and]: we multiply

      A coin tosses twice. What is the probability of getting a tail in both tosses.

      $$the\;outcome\;of\;the\;2^{nd}\;toss\;is\;independent\;from\;the\;1^{st}$$ <br />

      $$P(T and T)$$<br />
      $$=\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}$$<br />
      $$=\frac{1}{4}$$<br />

      A boy throws a fair coin and a regular tetrahedron with four faces marked 1, 2, 3 &
      4. Find the probability that he gets a three on the tetrahedron and a head from 
      the coin.

      $$P(H) = \frac{1}{2}$$ <br />
      $$P(3) = \frac{1}{4}$$

      $$\text{coin is independent from tetrahedron, we multiply}$$

      $$P(H and 3) = \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{4}$$

      $$=\frac{1}{8}$$

    $$P(B) = \frac{8}{13}$$<br />

    $$\text{White followed by Black}$$<br />
    $$P(W) = \frac{5}{13}$$<br />

## Tree Diagram

Tree diagrams allows us to see all possible outcomes of an event and calculate
their probability.

Each branch in a tree diagrams represents a possible outcome.

A tree diagram of a coin being tossed thrice looks like this:

From the tree above their are eight possible outcomes.

The sum of the probabilities of any set or branches is always 1.

To find the probability, we:
- Multiple along the branches
- Add vertically

From the above tree diagram,

1. Probability of 3 heads

$$P(HHH) = \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}$$ <br />
$$=\frac{1}{8}$$

2. Probability of 2 heads and a tail

$$P(HHT)\;or\;P(HTH)\;or\;P(THH))$$ <br />
$$=(\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2})$$ <br/ >
$$+(\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2})$$ <br/ >
$$+(\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2})$$ <br/ >
$$=\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac{1}{8}$$ <br/ >
$$=\frac{3}{8}$$
