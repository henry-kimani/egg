## Definition

Numerical Summary for a set of data is refered to as a statistic, if the dataset
is a sample and a parameter if the dataset is the entire population.

They are catergorized as:
- Measures of location 
- Measures of spread

Measures of locations are further classified into:
- Measures of central tendancy (averages)
- Measures of relative positioning (quantiles)

## Measures of Central Tendency

The measures of central tendecy, describes a set of data, by identifying the central
position in the dataset, as a single value. <br />
We can think of it as a tendency of data to cluster around a middle point.

There are three different types of central tendancies:

1. **Mean:** It is also known as the average. It is calcuated by adding all the values
in a data set and dividing by the total number of values.
2. **Median:** It is the middle value in a data set. It is calculated by arranging
the dataset in order, from lowest to highest and finding the value in the exact
middle.
3. **Mode:** It the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. 

## Mean

### Arithemetic Mean

Arithemetic mean is the simple average or sum of a series of numbers divided by
the count of that series of numbers. In short, its a fancy ways of saying average.

<SimpleLatex formula="=\frac{\text{sum of all numbers}}{\text{total number of numbers}}" />
<br />

For example, the arithemetic mean of values $$x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$$:

<SimpleLatex formula = "{\displaystyle = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}}" />

and is formed by:

<SimpleLatex 
  formula= "{
    \displaystyle
    \bar{x}=\sum _{i=1}^{n} \frac{Xi}{n} 
  }"
/>

or in simple terms 

<SimpleLatex formula="{\displaystyle =\frac{\sum x}{n}}" />

If the data includes frequencies,

<div class="text-3xl">$$=\frac{x_1f_1+x_2f_2+...+x_nf_n}{n}$$</div>

<SimpleLatex formula="{\displaystyle=\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}}" />

#### Ungrouped Data

Find the arithemetic mean of 4, 8, 12, 16, 20

<SimpleLatex formula="\bar{x}=\frac{\Sigma x}{n}" />

<SimpleLatex formula="=\frac{4+8+12+16+20}{5}" />

<SimpleLatex formula="=\frac{60}{5}" />

$$=12$$

#### Grouped Data

Estimate the mean for the data below

| class | $$f$$ (freq) | class bound | $$x$$ | $$n$$ (c.f)| $$xf$$ |
|-------|------|------------- |----------|-----|----|
| 6 - 9   | 5  | 4.5 - 9.5    | 7   | 5 | 35 |
| 10 - 14 | 12 | 9.5 - 14.5   | 12  | 17| 144 |
| 15 - 19 | 32 | 14.5 - 19.5  | 17  |49 | 544 |
| 20 - 24 | 40 | 19.5 - 24.5  | 22  |89 | 880 |
| 25 - 29 | 16 | 24.5 - 29.5  | 27  |105| 432 |
| 30 - 34 | 9  | 29.5 - 34.5  | 32  |114| 288 |
| 35 - 39 | 6  | 34.5 - 39.5  | 37  |120| 222 |

To solve the arithemetic mean for grouped data:

<Steps>
  
  1. Find the midpoint, $$x$$.

  2. Find the summation of frequency $$(\Sigma f)$$.

  3. Find $$xf$$ for each row.

  4. Find the summation of $$xf$$ $$(\Sigma xf)$$.

  5. Apply the below formula.

</Steps>

<SimpleLatex formula="{\displaystyle \bar{x}=\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}=\frac{2545}{120}=21.21}" />

### Geometric Mean

Let $$x_1,x_2, ... x_n$$ be the sample values. The geometric mean is given by:

<SimpleLatex formula="GM=\sqrt[n]{x_1*x_2, ... x_3}"/>

For data with frequencies,

<SimpleLatex formula="GM=\sqrt[n]{x_1^{f1}*x_2^{f2}* ... * x_3^{f3}}"/>


### Harmonic Mean

Let $$x_1,x_2, ... x_n$$ be the sample values. The harmonic mean is given by:

<SimpleLatex formula="HM=\frac{n}{\frac{1}{x_1}+\frac{1}{x_2}+...+\frac{1}{x_n}}"/>

For data with frequencies,

<SimpleLatex formula="HM=\frac{n}{\frac{f_1}{x_1}+\frac{f_2}{x_2}+...+\frac{f_n}{x_n}}"/>

### Weighted Mean

Let $$x_1,x_2, ... ,x_n$$ be values with weights $$w_1,w_2, ... , w_n$$. The $$WM$$
is given by:

<SimpleLatex formula="WM=\frac{x_1w_1+x_2w_2+...+x_nw_n}{w_1+ w_2+ ... + w_n}"/>
