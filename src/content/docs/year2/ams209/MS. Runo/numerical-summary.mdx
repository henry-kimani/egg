## Definition

Numerical Summary for a set of data is refered to as a statistic, if the dataset
is a sample and a parameter if the dataset is the entire population.

They are catergorized as:
- Measures of location 
- Measures of spread

Measures of locations are further classified into:
- Measures of central tendancy (averages)
- Measures of relative positioning (quantiles)

## Measures of Central Tendency

The measures of central tendecy, describes a set of data, by identifying the central
position in the dataset, as a single value. <br />
We can think of it as a tendency of data to cluster around a middle point.

There are three different types of central tendancies:

1. **Mean:** It is also known as the average. It is calcuated by adding all the values
in a data set and dividing by the total number of values.
2. **Median:** It is the middle value in a data set. It is calculated by arranging
the dataset in order, from lowest to highest and finding the value in the exact
middle.
3. **Mode:** It the value that appears most frequently in the dataset. 

## Mean

### Arithemetic Mean

Arithemetic mean is the simple average or sum of a series of numbers divided by
the count of that series of numbers. In short, its a fancy ways of saying average.

<SimpleLatex formula="=\frac{\text{sum of all numbers}}{\text{total number of numbers}}" />
<br />

<div>For example, the arithemetic mean of values:</div>

<SimpleLatex class="inline-block" formula="x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n" /> 

<SimpleLatex formula = "{\displaystyle = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n}}" />

and is formed by:

<SimpleLatex 
  formula= "{
    \displaystyle
    \bar{x}=\sum _{i=1}^{n} \frac{Xi}{n} 
  }"
/>

or in simple terms 

<SimpleLatex formula="{\displaystyle =\frac{\sum x}{n}}" />

If the data includes frequencies,

<SimpleLatex formula="{\displaystyle =\frac{\sum fx}{\sum f}}" />

For Example:

Estimate the mean for the data below

| class | freq | class bound | x | c.f | xf |
|-------|------|-------------|----------|-----|----|
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 10 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
| 6 - 9 | 5 | 4.5 - 9.5 | 7 | 5 | 35 |
