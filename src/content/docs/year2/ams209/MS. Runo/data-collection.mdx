## Sources of data
1. **Primary data:** Its is first hand information that is freshly collected, 
compiled and published for some purpose. They are original in character and 
haven't undergone any statistical treatment.

2. **Secondary data:** Second hand information mainly obtained from published 
sources such as encyclopedias, media reports etc. The are not original in 
character and have undergone some statistical treatment atleast once.

## Data collection methods

It is the first step of any invesigation and can be done directly or indirectly.
It is subdivided as shown below

`<Component />`

### 1. Experimental methods

The investigator in the laboratory tests the hypothesis about the cause-and-effect
relationship by manipulation the independent variables under controlled conditions.

### 2. Non-experimental methods

The investigator does not control or change any aspect of the situation under 
study but simply describes what naturally occurs at a certain point or period 
of time. Most of the methods are widely used on social sciences.

##### a. Field Study
<strong id="#def-hypothesis">Hypothesis:</strong> A proposed explanation, made on the basis of limited information.

Field study, field research, fieldwork is the collection of raw data outside a
laboratory, library or workplace setting.

It aims at testing hypothesis in natural life situations. It 
differs from field experiment since the researcher does not control or 
manipulate the independent variables, however, both of them (field study and 
field experiment) are carried out in natural conditions.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Merits">
      1. The method is easy and is carried out in natural conditions.
      2. Its easy to obtain data with large numbers of variables.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Demerits">
      1. Independent Variables are not manipulated.
      2. Cooperation of the organisation is often difficult to obtain.
      3. Data is likely to contain unknown sampling biases.
      4. The dross rate (proportion of irrelevant data) may be high in such
      studies.
      5. Measurement is not precise as in laboratory because of influence in
      confounding(confusing) variables.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### b. Census

Is a study that obtains information from every member of a population. In most
studies, its not practical because of the cost and/or time required.

##### c. Sample Survey

Is a study that obtains data from a subset(a "sample") of a population in order
to estimate population attributes/characteristics.

For example, say you want to know the average income of people in a city. Instead
of surveying every single person, you would conduct a sample survey by randomly
selecting 1000 residents and asking them about their income. Based on the data 
from this sample, you can estimate the average income of the entire city.

##### d. Case Survey

It is a method of intensively exploring and analyzing the life of a single social
unit e.g person, family, institution, cultural group or an entire community. 

> *A case study is an in-depth, detailed examination of a particular
case (or cases) with in a real-world context.* 
<Source href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study" name="Wikipedia" type="ref" />

The units are studied in nature, they are no attempts to exercise experiment or
statistical control and phenomena.

The researcher has discretion in gathering information from a variety of sources
such as diaries, letters, autobiograhpies.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Merits">
      1. Its less expensive that other methods.
      2. Its very intensive in nature - aims at studing a few units rather than several.
      3. Data collection is flexible since the researcher is free to approach the
      problem from any single angle.
      4. Data is collected from natural settings.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Demerits">
      1. Lacks internal validity which is basic to scientific evidence.
      2. Since they focus on one unit of the defined population, they can't make
      claims about how things work in general. Meaning, you can't assume what you
      learnt from one unit applies to a wider population.
      3. They are more time consuming than other methods.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

##### e. Experiment

Its a controlled study in which the researcher attempts to understand cause-and-effect
relationships. The information is drawn from the individuals/units under the 
experiment. 

The study is "controlled" in the sence the researcher controls how
*subjects are assigned* to groups and which *treatments each group receives.*

##### f. Observational Study

Like experiment, they attempt to understand the cause-and-effect relationship.
However, the researcher is unable to control the subjects are 
assigned to groups and/or which treatments each group receives. The invesigator
can only directly observe.

## Sampling

Sampling is the scientific process of selecting a representative sample.

### Defintion of terms
- **Population:** The entire set of individuals, objects or events that a researcher
is interested in studying.
- **Sample:** A subset of population selected for a study.
- **Sample Design:** The scheme, plan or strategy used to select a sample from 
the population
- **Sample Unit:** The element selected from the population for the inclusion in
the sample.
- **Unit of Analysis:** A statistical unit is an object of statistical survey 
(for example, an individual) and the bearer of statistical characteristics. 
Therefore, Unit of Analysis is the unit at which analysis will be done for 
inferring about the application.
- **Sampling Frames:** This is the list of all individuals (units), used in 
probability sampling, as the basis for the selection process of 
the sample.

### Sample Procedure 

Steps taken when choosing a sample. It can either be through probability sampling
or non-probability sampling.

`<Component />`

#### Sampling Procedure

1. How to select the elements?
2. How to estimate the populations characteristics?

#### Probability Sampling

Invoves a mathematical chance of selecting a respondent.

##### 1. Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

  It involes selecting elements randomly from the sampling frame. Each element
  has an equal probability of being selected from the list (of sample size *n* 
  and total population *N* ).

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Demerits">
      1. **Lack of a listing frame:** the method requires the sampling frame to
      be available, which is not the case for many populations.
      2. **Problem of small area estimation or domain analysis:** 
      3. **Not cost effective:** It requires covering the whole population from 
      a large geographical area. Interviewing few samples spread sparsely over
      a large area would be very costly.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Implementating It">
      1. Listing (sampling) frame.
      2. Use a random values from a published table or computer generated.
      3. Selecting the sample based of the random values.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### 2. Systematic Sampling

  Members of a population are selected from a random starting point and then at 
  regular intervals.

  Consider a population of 1000 students (N=1000) and a sample size of 100 (n=100).

<Steps>

1. Calculate the sample interval (k):

   ```bash
    k = N/n
    k = 1000/100
    k = 10 # sample interval
   ```

2. Choose a random starting point (r) between 1 and k. This will be the first member
    to select for the sample.

    ```bash
    # Between 1 to (k = 10)
    r = 3
    ```

3. Select subsequent members.

    `S`: Represents the choosen sample unit.

    `(r+k)`: is the operation done on the samples.

    `R`: Result is the number of the member that is choosen for the sample. Member
    `13, 23, 33 ...` are choosen for the sample.

    |S|(r + k)|R|
    |-----|-----|-----|
    |1st| 3 + 10| 13|
    |2nd| 13 + 10| 23|
    |3rd| 23 + 10| 33|
    
</Steps>

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Provides a better random sampling distribution that SRS.
      2. Simple to implement.
      3. May be started without a complete listing frame.
      4. With ordered list, the variance may be smaller that SRS.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. Periodic. There is a recurring pattern in the population that aligns 
      with the sampling interval, and can lead to biased results.
      2. Linear Trend. This trend makes it easy to predict the sample units, 
      therefore, the sample units cannot be considered fully random.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

  ###### When to use systematic sampling

  1. Prefered over SRS.
  2. When no list of population exists.
  3. When the list is roughly of random order.
  4. Small area/population.

##### 3. Stratified Sampling.

  Involves dividing the population into groups called *strata* and sampling (randomly
  selecting) is performed separately on each *stratum*.

  The technique is used when:
  1. The population may have different values for the responses of interest.
  2. When we want to improve our estimation for each group separately.
  3. To ensure adequate sample size for each group.

  In stratified sampling designs:
  1. Stratum variables are mutually exclusive (no over lapping). Meaning two or 
  more events cannot happend simultaneosly hence reducing sampling errors.
  2. The population (elements) should be homogenous within stratum and heterogeneous
  between the strata.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. You can study and make estimations of the variations for each stratum.
      2. Disproportionate (not in proportion to) sample may be selected for each 
      stratum.
      3. The precision is likely to increase, as variance maybe smaller than simple 
      random case with same sample size.
      4. Field works, can be organised using the strata. (by geographical areas 
      or regions)
      5. Reduced survey costs.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. A sampling frame is needed for each stratum.
      2. The analysis method is complex.
      3. Data analysis should take a sampling weight to counter the disproportionate
      sampling of the strata.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

###### Allocation of Stratified Sampling
  The major task is appropriate allocation of samples to different strata.

  **Types of allocations methods:**
1. Equal allocation. <br />
2. Proportion to stratum size. <br />
3. Cost based sample allocation. <br />

##### 4. Cluster Sampling

It involves dividing the population into clusters and randomly selecting clusters
to sample. Clusters are constructed as the sampling frame when there is unavailable
or too expensive to construct.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Cheap.
      2. Easy and quick to make.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. Less informative and less efficient per elements in the sample, due to 
      similarities of elements withing the same cluster. 

      The loss of efficiency, can be compensated by increasing the overall sample
      size.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### 5. Multistage

`To Do: `

##### Advantages of Probability Sampling

1. Provides a quantitative measure (e.g margin or error, confidence intervals) 
of the extent of variation, due to random effects.<br/>
Probability sampling, by its nature, introduces randomness. But it also gives us 
the random tools to understand and measure randomness.
2. Provides data of know quality.
3. Provides data in a timely fashion.
4. Provides acceptable data at a minimum cost.
5. Better control over non-sampling sources of errors.
6. Mathematical statistics and probability can be applied to analyze and interpret
the data.


#### Non-probability Sampling

  This is any sampling method where, some elements of the population have no chance
  of selection, or where the probability of selection can't be accurately 
  determined. (also called, "out of coverage", "undercovered").

  > *Not all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected. 
  This introduces some bias, but may be necessary is certain situations.*
  <Source name="A.I: Gemini" type="quote" />
  
  It is often used in situations where a researcher cannot select the kinds of 
  probability samples used in large-scale social surveys. 

##### a. Convenience
  
  This method involves choosing the individuals that are easy to find or accessible.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Its very fast to carry out with few rules governinig how the sample should
      be collected.
      2. The relative time and cost is small, in comparison to probability sampling
      techniques. Hence you can achieve the sample size you want relatively fast 
      and inexpensive way.
      3. The convenience sample may help you gather useful data the would not have 
      been possible using probability sampling techniques, since they require
      a more formal access to lists of populations.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. It undermines the ability to make generalizations. Since the sampling
      frame is unknown and the sample unit is not choosen at random, the sample
      is unlikely to represent the population being studied.

      2. It suffers from a number of biases. A convenience sample can 
      lead to the *under-representation* or *over-representation* of particular 
      groups. For example in a large organisation with multiple sites, the 
      employee satisfaction very considerably between these sites. Hence, conducting
      a survey only on the organisation's headerquaters can lead to biases, since
      we may have missed the difference between employee satisfaction in these sites.
      (the employee satisfaction in the headquaters differs from the non-office 
      workers).
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### b. Purposive/Judgement

  Elements are choosen based on the purpose of the study. 

  As other non-probability sampling techniques, it does not produce a sample 
  that is representative of a large population. <br />
  However, it can be what is needed in some cases e.g study of an organisation, 
  community etc.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. It provides a widerange of qualitative research designs which is needed
      in such research, for example, sampling strategy and sampling technique.
      2. Purposive sampling techniques have different goals, therefore provide
      researchers with the justification to make generalizations from the sample
      that is being studied.
      3. Purposive sampling allows for multiple phases in qualitative research.
      Therefore, a researcher has a widerange of non-probability sampling techniques
      to draw from.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. It is highly prone to bias since the researcher sampled the units based
      on his/her judgement.
      2. The subjectivity (influenced by personal feelings, tastes or opinion) 
      and non-probability based nature (not being random) of the unit selection,
      make it difficult to defend representativeness of a sample or argue the 
      sampling achieved theoretical/analytic/logical generalizations.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### c. Quota Sampling 

  It is designed to overcome the flaws of availability sampling (convenience 
  sampling). Rather than taking anyone, you set quotas to ensure that the sample
  you get, represents certain characteristics in proportion to the widespread 
  population.

  However, you would need to know the characteristics ahead of time.

  The primary problems is, even when you know the quota sample is representative
  of particular characteristics, there is no way to know if the sample is representative
  in terms of other characteristics. Say, we have quotas of age and gender, there
  is no way to know if they represent income or education or other factors.

  Also, interviews can be biased. Say the reseacher is to self-select males 
  between ages of 18-25, they are most likely to choose better-dressed, more
  approachable or less threatening individuals.

  ###### Steps of creating a quota sample

  1. Choose the relavent group characteristics and divided the population 
  according to gender.
  2. Calculate the quota (number of units that should be included in each group).
  3. Continue to invite units until the quota for each group is met.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Useful when you are unable to obtain a probability sample, but still
      want a sample that is representative as possible of the population being
      studied.
      2. Unlike stratified random sampling, it is quicker and easier to carry out
      because it does not require a sampling frame and use of strict random 
      sampling techniques.
      3. The quota sample improves the representation of a particular *stata*
      within a population while ensuring they are not over-represented.
      4. It allows comparison of groups.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. Since the sample is not choosen at random, its difficult to determine 
      possible sampling error.
      2. Therefore, its is *biased* (for not choosing randomly) hence thus no
      statistical inferences from the sample to the population leading to 
      problems of external validity.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

##### d. Snowball

  The researcher identifies one member of the population, speaks to them and 
  ask them to identify other individuals and refer them to the researcher.

  > *In sociology and statistics research, snowball sampling (or chain sampling,
  chain-referfal sampling, referral sampling) is a non-probability sampling 
  technique where existing study subjects recruit subjects from among their 
  aquiaintances. Thus the sample group is said to grow like a snowball.*
  <Source href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowball_sampling" name="Wikipedia" type="ref" />

  It is useful in cases where the members of a special population are difficult 
  to locate. For example, people affected with HIV/AIDS.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Allows the researcher to reach populations that are difficult to sample
      when using other sampling methods.
      2. The process is cheap, simple and cost-efficient.
      3. Requires little planning and fewer workforce compared to other sampling
      techniques.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. The researcher has little control over the sampling technique, since 
      subjects are mainly obtained depending on the previous subjects.
      2. Representativeness is not guaranteed because the researcher has no idea
      of the true distribution of the population and the sample.
      3. There is potential sampling bias, since initial subjects tend to refer
      individuals that they know well.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>   

### Limitations of Sampling

1. The sampling frame may need complete enumeration.
2. Errors of sampling may be high in small areas.
3. May not be appropriate for the study objectives/questions.
4. Representativeness may be vague.

## Survey Administration

#### a. Self-Administarted Survey

  This is any survey that requires the respondent to complete the questionnaire 
  by themselves. <br />
  They are useful in describing the characteristics of large populations and make 
  large sample feasible (achievable).

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. **Low cost:** No extensive training is required to administer the survey.
      Additionally, processing and analysis are usually simpler and cheaper than
      for other methods.
      2. **Reduction in biasing error:** The questionnaire reduces the bias that
      might result from personal characteristics of interviewers and/or their 
      interviewing skills.
      3. **Greater anonymity:** Absence of the interviewer provides greater 
      anonymity especially for sensitive issues.
      4. **Convenient to the respondents:** They may complete at whenever they want.
      5. **May provide reliable information:** They have an allowance to consult
      others or check records to avoid recall bias.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. **Requires simple questions:** 
      2. **No opportunity to probing:** The answers are accepted as final and researchers
      have no opportunity to clarify ambiguous answers.
      3. **Low response rate:** The respondents may not answer all the questions 
      and/or may not return the questionnaire.
      4. The respondent must be literate to read and understand the questionnaire.
      5. Introduce self-selection bias.
      6. Not suitable for complex questionnaire.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

#### b. Inverview Surveys

  It involves asking questions orally and record respondent's answers. It reduces
  the number of "don't know" or "no answer" responses as compared to questionnaires.

  The interviewer can also offer clarification if the question is mis-understood. <br />
  The interviewer should have good observation, listening and recording skills.
  They should also be familiar with the study objectives.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. **Flexibility:** This allows the interviewer to clarify terms if unclear.
      2. **Control of the interview situation:** They can ensure the interview
      is private and respondents do not have an opportunity to consult on another.
      before giving their answers.
      3. **High response rate:** The response time from the respondent in interviews
      are higher than questionnare.
      4. May record non-verbal behavior, activities or facilities.
      5. A complext questionnare maybe used.
      6. Illiterate respondents may participate.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. **Higher costs:** Costs are involved in selecting, training and supervising 
      interviewers; Paying them.
      2. **Interviwer bias:** The flexibility allows for interviewer's personal
      influence and bias.
      3. **Lack of anonymity:** Often the interviewer knows all the respondents
      resulting in fear and intimidation by the respondent, especially in sensitive
      questions.
      4. Less accessibility
      5. Inconvinience
      6 Often no opportunity to consult records, families, relatives.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

#### c. Telephone Interiew

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Less expensive.
      2. Shorter data collection period than personal interviews.
      3. Better response that mail surveys.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. Biased against households without a telephone or an unlisted number.
      2. Non-response during the telephone interview.
      3. Difficult for sensitive issues or complex issues.
      4. Limited to verbal responses. Cannot observe non-verbal ques.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>

#### d. Focus Groups

  Focus groups are a group of people who poses certain characteristics and provide
  information of a qualitative nature in a focused discussion. <br />
  They are generally composed of 6-10 people.

  Size is controlled by two factors:
  - Small enough for everyone to participate.
  - Large enough to provide divesity.

  This groups is special in terms of:
  - Purpose
  - Size
  - Composition
  - Procedures

  Participants are selected because they have certain characteristics in common
  that relate to the topic at hand, such as parents of gang members. <br />
  Generally, they are unfamilar with each other.

  <Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Advantages">
      1. Flexibility allows the moderator to probe (inquire) for more in-depth
      analysis and ask participants to elaborate on their responses.
      2. Outcomes are quickly known.
      3. Less costly in planning and conducting than large surveys and personal 
      interviews.
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Disadvantages">
      1. A skilled moderator is essential.
      2. Because of the qualitative nature of the data, differences between groups
      can be troublesome to analyze.
      3. Groups are difficult to assemeble since people may take time to come and
      designate a place at particular time.
    </TabItem>
  </Tabs>
