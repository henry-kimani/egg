## Introduction

### Definition

Statistics is a branch of science that deals with the collection, presentation,
analysis and interpration of data.

### Two Broad Categories of Statistics

Statistics is subdivided into two:

1. **Descriptive Statistics:** A summary value and presentation taht give info
about data.

2. **Inferential Statistics:** summary value calculated from the sample inorder
to make a conclusion of the target population.

### Types of variables 

#### Qualitative variables

Characteristic: a feature or quality belonging to a person, place or thing.

A qualitative variable is a variables describing a characteristic. The are also
called *categorical variables* because they can be separated into groups or 
categories.

###### For Example:

Male and female are vairables that describe a person's characteristic. The variables
can fall in the category, gender.

| Category | Variables|
| ---------| ------ |
| Gender   | Male, Female|

There are two classes of qualitative variables:

1. **Nominal variables:** variables whose categories are just names with no 
natural order. e.g gender, marital status, religion etc.

2. **Ordinal variables:** variables whose categories have a natural order. e.g
education level, performance category, degree classification etc.

#### Quantitative variables

Quantitative variables are numerical varibles and can have mathematical operations
applied to them. For each of these variables we can learn important information
by finding averages, standard deviations, and variances.

1. **Discrete variables:** can only assume certain values and there are gaps 
between them.

2. **Continuous variables:** can assume any value in a specified range.

#### Determining between qualitative and quantitative variables

1. Is it displayed as a number? if not its qualitative.

2. If a number, ask, is finding the average data tell something useful? if it
would, then its qualitative.

3. Can you split the data into categories or sub-groups? If you can its a 
qualitative variable. 

```js
let variable;

if (varible === number) {
    variable = "quantitative";
} else {
    variable = "qualitative";
}
```
