1. **Raw data:** Unprocessed data from

2. **Frequency Distribution:** Organzing raw data in tables in form of classes
and frequency.

## Ungrouped Data

### Construction of Ungrouped distribution

Note the largest and smallest value of the data.
Starting with the smallest value tally the observation of each quantity.
Count the number of tallys for each quantity and record it as frequency 

**For example:** <br />
Contruct an ungrouped frequency table for the data below:

```
16, 14, 15, 13, 12, 14, 16, 15, 15, 14, 17, 16, 13, 16, 15, 14, 18, 13, 15, 17
```


| Value | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|Tally | <Tally bars={1} />| <Tally bars={3} />| <Tally bars={4} />| <Tally bars={5} />| <Tally bars={4} />| <Tally bars={2} />|<Tally bars={1} />|
|Frequency| 1 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 2| 1 |

## Grouped data

| Class intervals | Frequency | Class boundaries |
|-------|-----------|----|
|492 - 495| 4 | 491.5 - 495.5
|496 - 499| 11 |495.5 - 499.5
|500 - 503| 18 |499.5 - 503.5
|504 - 507| 10 |503.5 - 507.5
|508 - 511| 7 |507.5 - 511.5

Data that is organized and summarised as above is called grouped data. <br />

- It has various class intervals (class limits), upper and lower class limits.
A *class interval* is the lowest and highest value defined for a class or group. <br />
- Also, it has class boundaries which are obtained by averaging the upper class 
limit of 1 class with the lower class limit of the following class.


#### Calculating the class boundaries 

<Steps>
  1. Subtract the upper class limit of the first class from the lower class limit
  of the second class. 

      <SimpleLatex formula="496-495=1" />
  
  2. Divide the result by two. 

      <SimpleLatex formula="\frac{0.1}{2}=0.5" />

  3. Subtract the 0.5 from lower class limits and add 0.5 to the upper class limits.

      <SimpleLatex formula="492-0.5=491.5" />

      <SimpleLatex formula="495+0.5=495.5" />

      The table above has the detailed results.


</Steps>

## Graphical displays

After organizing the data into a frequency distribution, you can present them
in a graphical form. <br />
The purpose of the graphs and stats, is to convey the data into views that are
easier to comprehend.

This includes:
1. Pie charts
2. Bar charts
3. Histrograms
4. Frequency polygon
5. Cumulative freq graph

### Pareto graphs

They represent frequency distribution for catergorical values.
The bars are of the same width.
The data is arranged from the largest to the smallest according to frequency.

### Histograms

For ungrouped data, the height of each bar is proportional to the frequency. <br />
For grouped data, the height of each rectangle is the relative frequency *h* and
is given by:

<SimpleLatex formula="h=\frac{frequency}{class\,interval}" />

The width of the bars (x-axis) is determined by the class boundaries.

Construct a histogram to represent the data shown below.

export const histogramFreq = [ 2, 8, 18, 13, 7, 1, 1 ];

export function computeHeight(freq, classInterval = 5) {
  return freq/classInterval ;
}

| Class | Frequency | $$h$$ |
|-------|-----------|-----|
|100 - 104 | 2 | {computeHeight(2)}|
|105 - 109 | 8 | {computeHeight(8)} |
|110 - 114 | 18 | {computeHeight(18)} |
|115 - 119 | 13 | 2.6 |
|120 - 124 | 7 | 1.4 |
|125 - 129 | 1 | 0.2 |
|130 - 134 | 1 | 0.2 |

<br />

<Histogram classRange="100-104" classInterval={5} frequency={histogramFreq} />

### Frequency Polygon

Is a plot of frequecy against midpoints joined with a straight line.

### Cumulative Frequency curve (ogives)

A plot of cumulative frequecy against upper boundaries.

### Data stem and leaf

Is a data plot that uses part of the data value as the stem and the other as 
the leaf.
Its easy to identify the mode smallest value and the largest value e.g

Represent the data below in a steam and leaf plot

```
25, 31, 20, 32, 13, 14, 43, 02, 57, 23, 36, 32, 33, 32, 44, 32, 52, 44, 52, 45
```

Arrange the data in a assending order:

```
02, 13, 14, 20, 23, 25, 31, 32, 32, 32, 32, 33, 36, 43, 44, 44, 45, 51, 52, 57
```

| Stem | Leaf|
|------|------|
| 0 | 2 |
| 1 | 3, 4 |
| 2 | 0, 3, 5 |
| 3 | 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 6 |
| 4 | 3, 4, 4, 5 |
| 5 | 1, 2, 7 |
