## Terrorism

The United Nations defines terrorism as:
> Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general
public, a group of 2 persons or a particular person for political purposes.

However, this definition underscores the political motivation behind terrorist's
acts and their deliberate targeting of non-combatants to acheive broader
objectives.

### Terrorist's Motivation

Terrorism must be considered as outcome of both individual motives and strategic
considerations on an organizational or group level.

Their motivations is a complex interplay of economic, social, political or 
ideological factors:

1. **Economic:** Poverty, unemployment, and economic inequality cause radicalization.
Also, disparities in wealth and access to resources exacerbate grievances,
particularly in marginalized communities.

2. **Social:** Alienation, discrimination or lack of education foster an environment
where extremist ideologies can thrive.

3. **Religious:** Misinterpretations of religious doctrines and the manipulation
of faith by etremist leaders drive religiously motivated terrorism.

4. **Political:** Authoritarian regimes, political opppressions and unresolved
terriorial disputes breed resentment and militancy. The failure for political 
systems to address grievances exacerbates tensions.

5. Other include, Globalization, techonological advancements and the proliferation
of small arms and light weapons have faciliated the spread of terrorism.

### Preventive Measures

To prevent terrorism, following measures are recommended

1. **Developing National Strategies:** States must adopt comprehensive counter-terrorism
strategies encompassing prevention, response and recovery. These strategies should
prioritize intelligence gathering, inter-agency coordination and public awareness
campaigns.

2. **Strengthening International Cooperation:** Enhanced collobration among
states, regional borders and international organizations is essential to address
the transnational nature of terrorism. 

3. **Addressing root causes:** Tackling the social-economic and political factors
is required and the initialtives should focus on poverty alleviation, education,
conflict resolution and promoting inclusive governance.

4. **Aligning with UN Resolutions:** States should align with couter terrorism 
efforts with international norms and standards, ensuring compliance with human
rights and humanitarian principles.

5. **Building national intellectual systems:** Promoting critical thinking,
fostering, interfaith dialogue and coutering extremists narratives through 
education and media are vital for long-term resillence against terrorism.
