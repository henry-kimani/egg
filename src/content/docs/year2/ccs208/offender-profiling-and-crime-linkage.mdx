Offender profiling originated from an FBI agent, Robert Ressler.

He defined profiling as the process of identifying all psychological characteristics
of an individual and forming a general description of their personality based on
the analysis of the crime they have committed.

Investigators can then use these set of characteristics to link to cases committed
by the same perpetrator.

There are two methods:
- Top down approach
- Bottom up approach

The goal of criminal profiling is to allow the law enforcement to narrow down 
the list of suspects thus allowing them to direct their resources where they might
do most good.

Criminal profiling is used since the offender did not leave any physical trace 
at the crime scene. It is also important to use this method in conjuction with
other methods and should not be later incorporated when investigators have 
relieazed there is no physical trace left in the crime scene.

## Criminal Staging

It occurs when the offender alters the crime scene inorder to conceal the original
intent. This misleads the authorities and/or redirect the investigation. This is
commonly done by organized offenders.

For example, stage signs of burglary to conceal a homicide.

#### Types of criminal staging

1. The perpetrator changes elements of the scene to make the death appear a sucide
to cover up a murder.

2. Redirecting an investigation by making the crime appear to be sex-related homicide.

3. Arson to destroy evidence or make the death appear as a result of an accidental
fire.

## Modus Operandi (Mode of Operation)

An offenders method of operation may include:
- the type of victim choosen
- location of attack
- time of attack
- type of weapon used
- the method of gaining entry.

It could be used to link cases, however, it should be used in caution as the
mode of operation of the offender are subject to change.

For example, an offender who uses bare hands to strangle victims, could start 
using stokings or pillow to suffocate them.

## Offender's Signature

It should be differenciated from modus operandi. The offender signature is the 
unique manner in which they commit crimes. For example, a manner in which a 
person kills, certain words a rapist uses with victims or a particular manner
in which a perpetrator leaves a crime scene.

The signature component refers to the psychodynamics, which are the mental and 
emotional processes underlying human behavior and its motivation.

In fact, when an offender displays behavior within the crime scene and engages
in activies that go beyond those necessary to accomplish the act, he is revealing
his signature.

## Crimes suitable for Profiling

1. Crimes where the perpetrator showed elements of psychopathy.
2. Crimes believed to be a part of a series.
3. Violent Crimes
4. Attacks on strangers.
5. Contact crimes - where the offender engaged in long conversations and 
communications wit the victim.
6. Serial murders.
7. Serial rapes.
8. Sexual homicides.
9. Ritual crimes.
10. Arson.
11. Hostage taking.

## Types of Criminal Groups

### Organized criminals

They often portary the following characteristics:

1. Intelligent
2. Socially and sexually competent.
3. Did not live alone.
4. Planned their attacks

### Disorganized criminals

They often portary the following characteristics:

1. Not as intelligent.
2. Socially and sexually incompetent.
3. Lived alone.
4. Were spontaneous in their attacks.

## Top Down Approach

It uses pre-existing knowledge and theories about criminal behavior.

### Stages of Collecting information

1. **Data assimilation:** Involves gathering and reviewing all the information
from the crime scene e.g evidence, witness statements etc.

2. **Crime Scene Classification:** Investigators analyze the crime scene to
determine whether its organized or disorganized.

3. **Crime Reconstruction:** This stage focuses on reconstructing the sequences
of events, the offender's and victim's behavior and pre-planning the might 
have occurred based on the crime analysis.

4. **Creating the profile:** After analyzing the crime scene and reconstructing 
the crime, investigators generate a profile of the offender e.g demographics, 
characteristics, behavioral patterns or possible motives.

## Bottom Up Approach

It analyzed evidence from the crime scene to build an offener profile, focusing on 
patterns and behaviors. It utilizes crime scene analysis, behavioral analysis and
geographical analysis.

If focuses on the individual person committing the crime and the unique circumstances
the crime took place.

## Canter's Circle Theory

The theory states that, if you draw a circle around the locations of the crime
scenes, the offender is likely to stay in the middle.

Their spatial decision making can offer investigative teams important insights
into the nature of the offense - whether the crime was planned or optimistic,
mode of transport, employment status.

## Characteristics that should be in a profile

1. Personal Characterists.
2. Personality traits.
3. Criminal History.
4. Whether they are a repeat offender.
5. Residential location.

## Methods of Offender profiling

1. **Geographic Profiling:** Analyzes the spatial patterns of crimes to determine 
the most suitable are of offender residence or operation. It assumes the offender
is more likely to offend closer to home.

2. **Typological Profiling:** Classifies the offender in broad categories (organized, 
disorganized) based on the crime scene characteristics. However, its critized for
its simplicity and lack of empirical support.

3. **Investigative Psychology:** Focuses on the consistency of offender behavior
across different crimes. It uses statistical analysis to identify patterns and
themes in criminal actions.

> *Studies criminal behavior and the investigative process to understand offenders
and their actions, ultimately aiding in crime solving and legal proceedings.*

Five aspects are often considered:
  - Interpersonal narrative: How the offender interacts with the victim.
  - Significance of time and place: The timing and location of the crime.
  - Criminal career: The offender's history of criminal activity.
  - Forensic awareness: The offender's knowledge of forensic techniques.
  - Control: The degree of control the offender exerts over the victim and crime
  scene.

4. **Clinical/Psychiatric Profiling:** Developed by psychiatrists and psychologists,
this approach focuses on the offender's personality, characteristics, motivations
and mental state. It often involves analyzing the psychological aspects of the 
crime and the victim.

5. **Behavioral Evidence Analysis:** Its a holistics approach that combines
elements of other methods. It involves a detailed analysis of the crime scene,
victimology and offender behavior to develop a profile. It emphasizes the 
importance of understanding the meaning behind the offender's actions.

## Stages of Criminal Profiling

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering all the information about a crime including 
crime scene photos, witness statements, victim information and forensic evidence.

2. **Crime Scene Analysis:** Examining the physical evidence and the way the crime
was committed to identify patterns and characteristics of the offender.

3. **Victimology:** Studing the victim's background, lifestyle and relationship
with the offender (if any) to understand why they might have been targeted.

4. **Profile Generation:** Developing a profile that includes demographic 
characteristics, behavioral patterns, personality traits and possible motivations
of the offender.

5. **Profile Comparison:** Comparing the profile with known suspects or using it
to generate leads of investigations.

6. **Ongoing Assessment:** Revising and refining the profile as new information
becomes available during the investigation.

## Limitations and Criticisms of Criminal Profiling

1. **Lack of Empirical Validation:** Some profiles have been criticized for lacking
strong empirical support.

2. **Potential for Bias:** Profilers may be influenced by their own biases and 
stereotypes, leading to inaccurate profiles.

3. **"Art" vs "Science" Debate:** Some argue that profiling is more of an art
than a science, relying on heavy intuition and experience, which can be subjective.

4. **Risk of Misleading Investigations:** Inaccurate profiles can lead investigators
down the wrong path and waste valuable time and resources.

5. **Ethical Concerns:** Profiling can raise ethical issues, particularly when
it relies on stereotypes or generalizations about certain groups of people.
