Eye witness testimony is regarded a powerful form of evidence in both civil and
criminal trials. It can sway judges and juries, often leading to convictions.

However, it does have is short comings. Memory is reconstructive rather than
repoductive, meaning it is subject to various distortions and biases.

## Accuracy of a witness testimony

There are several factors that affect the accuracy of a witness testimony.

1. **Conditions which the witness observed the event:** Poor lighting, distance
and brief exposure to the event can significantly impair the witness' ability 
to recall details accurately.

2. **Stress and Anxiety:** Stress and anixiety during crime can affect memory.
High-stress situations, such as violent crimes can impair a witnesses ability to
encode and recall details acurately.

3. **Passage of time:** Memories can fade and details may become less precise 
with time.

4. **Misinformation:** Misinformation or post-event information i.e information
presented after the fact, can distort the events that the witness tries to recall.

5. **Reconstruction:** Eye witnesses may reconstruct memories of an event based
on what they believed should have happened, rather than what actually happend.

## Validity of eye-witness testimony

Validity of a eye-witness testimony validity refers to the accuracy of eye-witness
testimony in accurately depicting what actually occured.

Although eyewitness testimony can be reliable, it not always valid. It may be 
influenced by the following factors.

1. **Perception:** Witnesses may have perpectual limitations that affect what
they see, such as poor lighting or limited viewport.

2. **Attention:** Witnesses may not pay attention to all details of an event, 
leading them to miss critical details.

3. **Suggestibility:** Witnesses may be influenced by suggestions from law 
enforcement, media or other witnesses.

4. **Bias:** Witnesses may have preconceived notions that affect how they recall
and interpret an event.

## Improving the reliability and validity of eyewitness testimony

### Cognitive Interviewing

Cogntive Interviewing (CI) involves using open-ended questions
and encourages the witness to recall as much details as possible. This method 
has been shown to improve recall accuracy compared to a standard interviewing
techniques.

Developed by Ronald Fisher and Edward Geisel, it collects information from 
cooperative witnesses. Its techniques are based on scientific priniciples of 
cognitive and social psychology, intended to facilitate witness memory and
communication between the witness and the interviewer.

### Common errors during interviews

#### 1. Inappropriate questions

These are questions that yield a small amount of detail and incorrect information
from witnesses.

They are classified into four types:

1. **Inappropriate closed-ended questions:** They are questions often restricted
to a yes or no response and often asked at random points in the interview.

2. **Leading Questions:** They are questions that actually suggest the answer to
the witness e.g You witnessed the crime, right?

3. **Multiple Questions:** It is when the interview asks more that one question
at a time e.g where did you go, what did you do, when did you go home. 

4. **Forced Choice Questions:** This involves forcing a witness to choose between
a limited number of possible options of answering. e.g was the color of the car
blue or black.

#### 2. Interrupting Witnesses

Interrupting a witness before they complete answering a questions is worrisome.

This is because they shorten a witnesses response (if a witness does not go back
to their complete thoughts) and reduce the cognitive effort used by to provide
an accurate and detailed report.

Avoiding interruptions faciltate greater recall, as witnesses are able to focus
on extracting important crime information.

#### 3. Overtalking

Interviewers tend to not follow the 80/20 rule, where the interviewer should only
talk 20% of the time.

Not giving a witness their own time to provide their account of the events, may
result in reduction in cognitive effort by the witnesses, reducing the likelyhood
of their provision of a complete account of events.
