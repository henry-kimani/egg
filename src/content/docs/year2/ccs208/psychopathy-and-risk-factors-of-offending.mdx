## Introduction

Psychopathy is often described as untreatable personality disorder consisting
of an apparent absense of empathy and remorse, along with superficial charm,
shallow relationships and rational, cold-blooded self-gratification, which 
often occurs at the expense of others.

The label can produce significant consequences in the legal realm, such as 
increased sentence severity and likelyhood of execution and harsher less engaged
treatment in community settings.

Psychopath and sociopath are used interchangeably, however, they are distinct
in how one interprets the origins and determinants of each.

Psychopaths are those who are labelled with a predominant biological etiology
while sociopaths, 

The same applies for primary and secondary psychopathy.

Primary psychopathy is thought to be as a result of biological deficits while
secondary psychopathy is attributed with various social disadvantages.

Research concludes that genes influence the brain structure that are associated 
with psychopathic tendancies while the environment merely act to shape psychopathic
characteristics, which manifest in childhood as callous unemotional (CU) traits,
and are then stable throughout the lifespan.

Bowbly (1944) described 14 "affectionless psychopaths". He hypothesized that 
deficits in early bonding with a consistent caregiver had caused these young people
to perceive others as unworthy of trust, empathy and concern. Subsequently,
insecure attachment patterns and neglectful and maltreating family environments
have been reported for individuals high in psychopathic traits.

Therefore, early care giving is key to healthy emotional development, specifically,
caregiver attunement and responsiveness in infant's emotional and physical needs
is critical for many psychological and physiological development processes.

For instance, variations in maternal sensitivity and intrusivenss affected infants'
social interaction, with infants whose mothers were less sensitive and/or more
intrusive showing significantly less interest in social interaction and significantly
more negative affect than those whose mothers were more sensitive and more instrusive.

## Risk Factors of Offending

Risk factors are individual, social and environmental elements whose presence 
increases the probability or criminal behaviour.

### Individual Risk Factors and their Characteristics

Individual risk factors may include personal propensities, habits, cognitions,
attitudes and emotions.

Some are associated with criminal behaviour including high implusivity or lack
of self-control, anti-social beliefs and addition to alcohol and other toxic
substances.

#### Anti-Social Behaviour

Anti-social behavior in childhood is a one of the best future predictors of delinquency.

Adolescents who engage in anti-social behaviors (theft, fighting, vandalism) before
puber(prior to age 13) are more likely to be delinquent than those who have not 
engaged in these acts prior to puberty.

Also, research suggests that violent careers often begin with relatively minor
forms of anti-social behavior that escalate over time. For example, those with
an early arrest (before age 13) are more likely to be chronic offender before by
age 18. Such chronic offender make up a small percentage of offenders but are 
responsible for the majority of serious violent crimes.

Additionally, youths who engage in delinquency early, tend to engage in a broad
of anti-social behavior rather than specialize in a particular type of offending.

Therefore, early childhood is an important development period to target for the 
prevention of juvenile delinquency.

#### Substance Abuse

Chronic abuse of drugs and alcohol is a precursor to other dangerous behaviours
including criminal activity.

Although experimentation of drugs during adolescence is not unusal, excessive
use is a risk factor for delinquency.

This is because drugs tend to impair judgement.

#### Congitive Deficits

Cognitive deficits have been implicated as a risk factor of delinquent behavior.
Low IQ scores, weak verbal abilities, learning disabilities and difficulties with
concentration or attention have been associated with subsequent delinquency.

Social-cognitive development is important because it affects one's ability to 
learn social norms and expectations.

For example, studies show that delinquent youths are more likely than their peers
to think that other children's behavior is deliberately hostile, even when it is
not. Though not conclusive, studies suggest that such cognitive deficits usually
precede the development of delinquency and not vice versa.

#### Psychological Factors

Youths who are implusive, hyperactive and engage in risk-taking behaviors are more
prone to delinquent acts than those who are not. 

Self-control, has been suggested by some to be the root individual-level determinant
of crime throughout the life course. Person's with low self-control:
- lack diligence
- find it difficult to delay gratification
- have little torrence for frustration
- lack of long-term persuits
- have little ability to resolve problems through verbal means rather than physical
means.

Youths who approach new stimuli impulsively or aggressively, tend to be more
likely to offend unlike those who approach new stimuli with anxiety or timidly.

Interestingly, motor restlessness (fidgeting - inability to sit still) in 
kindergarten is a strong perdictor of delinquency in between age 10 and 13 than
low anxiety or lack of prosocial behavior.

In fact, children who become persistent offender are more likely than their 
peers to suffer from Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

#### Brain Development

Neuropsychological deficits (often initially manifested as subtle cognitive deficits
or difficult termperament) have been linked to delinquency and chronic offending.

Anatomical, chemical and neurological abnormalities are more prevalent among 
choronic criminal offenders and those exhibiting recurrent anti-social behavior
than among the general population. These abnormalities maybe caused by damage to
a specific brain region or by a variety of behavioral or environmental factors.

Adolescences is a time for marked brain development in many regions, including 
areas implicated in various aspects of self-control. Therfore, neurological 
development during adolescence has a significant effect on emotional regulation.

### Social Risk Factors and Social Influences

Social risk factors combine all possible criminal influences arising from the
family, school, friends and social environment. These particularly include
affective and educational deficiencies in the family and school as well as the
possible links of youths with delinquent friends.

#### Family

Family structure, family characteristics and family dynamics have been connected 
to juvenile offending. The effect is more pronounced in early childhood.

While some have reported that single-parent households are at risk of delinquent
behavior, these differences are found to be negligible when difference in 
socialeconomic status are taken into account.

Interestingly, family size have been connected to juvenile delinquency, with youths
having more siblings, being more likely to engage in delinquent behaviors.

The best predictors of family-level delinquency include:
- lack of parental supervision
- inconsistent discipline
- hostile or rejecting parenting styles.
- children who witness or are victims of abuse

Additionally, aggressive behavior have been found to run in families. Having an
anti-social sibling, especially one close in age, increases a child's a likelyhood
of engaging in delinquent behavior. Also, youths whose parents engage in anti-social
behavior are more likely to do so themselves.

#### Peers
Social networks among peers grow substantially during adolescence.

This explains why youths commit crimes in groups and certain characteristics of 
a youth's peer group increase their likelyhood of offending.

Foremost, individuals with delinquent friends are more likely to offend than 
individuals without delinquent friends by influencing an individual's behavior
(known as socialization). Additionally, delinquent adolescents are more likely
to seek out befriend other delinquents (known as selection). Hence antisocial
peer influence can be self-reinforcing.

The age and gender of an adolescents's peers matter, as having older friends is
associated with greater likelyhood of offending and male peers are more likely
to encourage anti-social behavior than female peers.

Interestingly, aggressive children who are universally rejected are at greater
risk of becoming chronic juvile offenders than are aggressive chldren who are not
rejected.

### Environmental Risk Factors and Environmental Conditions

Environmental risk factors are all those situations and opportunities that
precede crime and may facilitate and stimulate them. For example, unprotected
properties, vulnerable victims and living in criminogenic neighborhoods.

##### Neighborhoods

People raised in disadvantaged neighborhoods are at greater risk of becoming 
juvenile offenders than children from affluent neighborhoods. Even when socioeconomic
status and school are taken into account, it still remains significant.

This is because disadvantaged neighborhoods have weak social control due to 
isolation and high residential turnover hence delinquent behavior is more likely 
to go unnotices or ignored by others in the commmunity.

##### School

Youths who experience problems at school are more likely to engage in delinquent
behavior. Some of this problems include poor academic performance, weak connections 
at school and low education aspirations. 

Such problems make them more favourable
targets of gang recruitments. Additionally, despite doing well at school, they 
might be disadvantaged in the market place.

##### Others

The learning theory posits that behaviors is modeled after people we admire or
those we associate with, hence drug use is a learn behavior from friends and peers.


### Summary

The negative influence of peers tends to arise as a key risk factor later in
development, whereas family influences typically are most important during
earlier stages. Nevertheless, the influence of peers is magnified when the family
environment is not healthy.
