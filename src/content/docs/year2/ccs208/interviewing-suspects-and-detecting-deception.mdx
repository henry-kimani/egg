## The Reid Technique

Simply, its an interrogation process, however its much more than that.

It involves three primary stages:
- Fact analysis
- Investigative Interview
- Interrogation

### Fact Analysis

It involves the reviewing the **case facts** and **evidence** in effort to identify
- the potential scope of suspects
- the probability of the offender characteristics
- what their possible motive may have been.

The investigator should identify specific details that can be used to corroborate 
any confession made in the case.

There are two types of corroborating evidence they can use:

1. **Dependent:**
They are details the police know about, but choose to hold back. This involves
concealing from the media and suspects(that they question) so that they can be 
used to assess the credibility of a suspects confession. <br />
For example, how the victim was killed, how and where entry was made into the 
building or where the accelerant was poured etc

2. **Independent:**
It refers to details of the crime that only the offeder know (details he police
officer doesn't have) <br />
For example, where the murders weapon is located, how and where the subject
disposed of their bloody clothes, the location of the stolen property etc.

In the process of analyzing the case facts and evidence, the investigator should:
- develop a description of the crime scene - the way the crime appears to have been 
committed.
- the know details of the commission - implement used, place of entry, the presence
of incriminating factors against a particular subject.

Once the case facts and evidence has been analyzed, they should prepare an interview
strategy. This includes:
- a list of issues that should be discussed with each subject
- a list of possible questions that need to be asked (including any victim, witnesses
and suspects).

### Investigative Interview

At the begining of the interview, the investigator must comply with all legal 
requirements, maintaining an objective, neutral and fact-finding demeanor.

The investigative interview(Behavior Analysis Interview) should the following 
three questions:
1. the subject's background.
2. investigative questions (questions relevant to the specific issue under investigation).
3. behavior provoking questions.

#### 1. Subjects Background Questions

It includes questions on the biography of the subject. For example, the subject's
employment activities. If the subject is a student, their school activities or
a casual conversation about recent events.

The purpose is:
- to establish rapport with the subject and acclimate(harden off) the subject 
to the interview environment
- to establish a behavioral baseline

#### 2. Investigative Questions

They deal with the issue under investigation.

This may include first asking open-ended questions, to invite the subject to tell
their story.
- If a victim, what a happened
- If a witness, what did they see or hear
- If a suspect, what are the activities of the day

After the subject have share their initial story or their version of events, they
will ask additional questions to clarify the who, what, when, where, why and how
of the incident under investigation.

The investigator should explore factors that may have gave rise to incident. 
Also, resolve any inconsistencies or contradications that may have surfaced from
the interview of the other subjects or the from the investigative information.

#### 3. Behavior-Provoking Questions

They are questions that most truthful individuals answer on way, while deceptive
individuals answer in a completely different way. The questions should be just
casual inquaries.

**For example:**

> *"Jim, what do you think should happen to the person who did this (issue)?" The
principle of response is that most truthful subjects offer appropriate strong
punishment. For example, in a homicide investigation the truthful person may say,
"He should the rest of his life if jail." Whereas the deceptive individual, who
is thinking about himself, may say something like "That's hard to say...I guess
it depends of the circumstances".*

In the conclusion, the investigator will evaluate the:
- investigative and behavioral information 
- facts and evidence.

Then further decisions may be made, whether to:
- eliminate the subject from further investigation
- the investigation of the subject should continue
- initiate an interrogation of the subject

Many are interviewed, however, few are interrogated.

### Interrogation

The purpose of the interrogation is to learn the truth.

Some of the possible outcomes of a successful interrogation include:
- the subject may identify as innocent.
- May determine that the subject did not commit the offense under investigation,
but lied about some aspect of the investigation.
- May determine that the subject did not commit the offense under investigation,
but knows who did.
- the subject maybe identified as guilty

#### The Reid Nine Steps of Interrogation

1. The initial confrontation.
2. Theme development.
3. Handling denials.
4. Overcoming objections.
5. Procurement of the subject's attention.
6. Handling the subject's passive mood.
7. Presenting an alternative question.
8. Developing the details of the admission.
9. Converting the verbal confession to a written or recorded document.

The key of reid technique is to use theme development (using empathy, sound
reasoning and logic to elicit the truth). 

During theme development, the investigator should avoid any indications the 
minimization of the moral and psychological blame will relieve the subject of 
criminal resposibility.

Once the offender decides to tell the truth, the goal is to develop details about
the crime and stop the active persuasion.

#### Core Priniciples of the Reid Technique

The following are the basic priniciples that an investigator should follow when
they are conducting an interrogation:
1. Do not make any promises of leniency.
2. Do not threaten the subject of physical harm or inevitable consequences.
3. Do not conduct interrogations for an excesssively lengthy period.
4. Don't deny the subject of their rights.
5. Don't deny the subject the opportunity to satisfy their physical needs.
6. Be sure to withhold information about the details of the crime from the subject,
so that if they confess, they will reveal information only the quilty will know.
7. Exercise caution when questioning juveniles or individuals with mental or
psychological impairements.
8. The confession is not the end of the investigation. Investigate the confession
details to establish the authenticity of the subject's statements.
