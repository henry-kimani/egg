## Definition Psychology

It is the scientific study of the mind and behavior.

## Psychological Priniciples

These are the priniciples that helps us make sense of the vast complexity of 
human behavior, providing a framework of understanding, from the most basic 
instincts to our complex processes.

### 1. Nature vs Nurture

It is the discussion of our innate predispositions(nature) and environmental 
influences(nurture) to human development and behavior.

#### Definition of Nature vs Nurture

**Nature:** Refers to an individual's biological inheritance. Including genetic 
predispositions, inherited traits and biological maturation.

**Nurture:** It involves the impact on environmental influences on us. This includes
social interaction, cultural experiences and education.

#### Historical Perspectives

- **Nativism:** Argues that knowledge and abilities are innate i.e present from birth.
- **Empiricism:** Suggests that individuals are born without any pre-existing 
knowledge and the knowledge is acquired through experience. <br />
- **The Interactionist Perspective:** Nature and nurture interact and influence 
each other in complex ways to shape development.

#### Evidence of Nature influences

- **Twin Studies:** Comparing identical twins to franternal twins reveals high
inheritability of certain traits in identical twins therefore suggesting a
stronger genetic influence. <br />
- **Adoption Studies:** Comparing adopted children with their adoptive parents and
biological parents can helps us understand if its nature or nurture. If the 
child resembles the biological parents in a certain trait, it suggests a 
genetic influence.

#### Evidence of Nurture influences

- **Environmental Deprivation/Enrichment:** Humans or animals raised in deprived or
enriched environment can impact the in different ways. For example, children 
raised in neglectful environments may have cognitive and social deficits. <br/ >
- **Culture Influences:** Different cultures have different norms and practises that
can influence individuals and shape their behavior, values and beliefs. <br />
- **Learning and Conditioning:** 

#### Examples of Nature-Nurture interaction

- **Intelligence:** is fluenced by both genetic and environmental factors such as 
education, nutrition and social-stimulation. <br />
**Personality:** is shaped by both inherited predispostions and life experiences. <br />
- **Mental Health:** Mental health can be influenced by genetics, however, environmental
factors can trigger these predispositions.

#### The Epigenome

It is a study of how environmental factors can alter gene expressions without 
altering the underling DNA. <br />
These changes can be passed down to future generations
,therefore, highlighting that nurture can influence nature.

### 2. Behaviorism

It posits that all behavior is acquired through conditioning and interaction 
with the environment.

Behavioural Psychology states that behavior can be studied in a systematic and 
observable manner regardless of internal mental states.

Behaviorists believe that anyone can be trained to perform any task, within 
their physical capabilities. It only requires the right conditioning.

#### Type of Behaviorism

Both differ in their underlying assumptions about the causes of behavior.

1. **Methodological Behaviorism:** It states that behavior should be studied
scientifically, and mental states and cognitive processes do not add up to the 
understanding of behavior.

2. **Radical Behaviorism:** Behavior can be understood by looking into one's past
and present environment and the reinforcements within it, thereby influencing 
behavior positively or negatively.

#### Types of Conditioning
##### Classical Conditioning

A neural stimulus is paired with a naturally occurring stimulus. Eventually, the
neural stimulus evokes the same response as the naturally occurring stimulus,
even without the naturally occurring stimulus being present itself.

The learned behavior is known as the condtioned response.

1. **Learning Throught Association:**
Classical conditioning works by developing
an association between an environment stimulus and a naturally occurring stimulus.
For example, dogs associated presentation of food (something that triggers salivation
response, a natural stimulus) with the sound of a bell.

2. **Factors that Affect Conditioning:** The first part of conditioning, acquisition,
is established and strengthened. Factors such as <u>prominence of the stimuli</u> and
the <u>timing of the presentation</u> dictate how quickly an association is formed.<br />
When an association disappears, extinction, it causes the behavior to weaken and 
vanish gradually. Factors such as <u>the strength of the original response</u> dictate
how quickly extinction occurs.

##### Operant Conditioning

Also called instrumental conditioning, is a method of learning that occurs 
through reinforcement and punishment (Behaviorist B.F. Skinner).

An association is formed between a behavior and a consequence of that behavior.

For example, if a parent rewards their child with praise everytime they pick up
their toys, the desired behavior is consistently reinforced. The child will be 
more likely to clean up messes.

**Timing Plays a Role:** The timing of these rewards plays a role on how quickly
this behavior is aquired and the strength of the response. This can invoke 
either continous or partial reinforcement.

Continous reinforcement involves rewarding every single instance of the behavior.
It is often used at the begining of the process. As behavior is learnt, partial
reinforcement can be used.

Partial reinforcement involves offering reward after a number of responses or 
after a period has elapsed.

### 3. Cognitive Psychology

#### Overview and Definition

Cognitive theory posists that a person's thoughts controls his actions, personality
and some degree, his circumstances. 

This sharply contrasts behavioral theory,
which states that there is an interrelationship between an individual's behavior
and his physical environment. The two were merged to form the cognitive-behavioral
theory.

The main idea is, an individual becames what he thinks. Therefore, behaviors are
the direct result of internal thoughts, which can be controlled. Some experts
argue that cognitive therapy is more effective than antidepressants alone.

##### Critics

1. An individual perceptions are not only influenced by his own perceptions, but 
by the perceptions of others in their environment. For example, feedback in terms
of criticism might simulate thoughts that are beyond the control of the recepient.

2. Cognitive therapy is relatively undefined and difficult to apply to the 
population as a whole.

#### Cognition

Cognition refers to the manner in which we interpret, analyze, remember and use
information about the social world.

#### Schemas

A schema is the cognitive framework that helps use organize and interpret information.
It is organized in a long-term mental model which may have a strong tendancy to
remain unchanged even in the face of contradictory information.

#### Heuristics

They are mental shortcuts that allow people to solve problems and make judgements
quickly. This is done to avoid cognitive overload. As a result, it faciliates
timely decision making that may not be the best, but appropriate enough.

##### Types of Heuristics

1. Availability heuristics involves making decisions based on how quickly it is 
to bring something to mind.
2. Familiarity heuristics refers to how often people have favourable opinions on
things, people or places they have experienced before as opposed to new onws.
3. Representative heuristics involves making decisions by comparing the present 
situation to the most representative mental prototype. For example, a person
who talks like your grandma, you might think they act the same since that person 
matches closely with the mental representation you have her (you grandma).
4. Affective heuristics involves making decisions that influence and individual's
emotions at the moment. For example, negative emotions lead people to focus on
the potential downsides of a decision rather than the positive benefits.
5. Anchoring involves the tendancy to be overly influenced by the first it of 
information we hear or learn.
6. Scarcity is a principle in which we view things that are scarce to use as
more valuable.

#### Potential Sources of Error in Social Cognition

Social cognition focuses on how people process, store and apply information about
other people and social situations.

##### 1. Biases

- **The negative bias**: refers to the fact that we show greater sensitivity to negative
information than to positive information.

- **The optimistic bias:** refers to the tendancy to overestimate our chances of 
positive experiences and underestimate our chances of negative experiences. <br />
Also we often have a greater confidence in our own judgement that is justified - over
confidence barrier. <br />
Planning fallacy, tendancy to make optimistic predictions concerning how long a
given task will take to complete.

##### 2. Counterfactual Thinking

It involves the human tendancy to create possible alternatives to life events 
that have already occurred; something that is contrary to what actually 
happened.

Thinking about what might have been, through statements such as "What if?".

As it states: "Counter to the facts".

For example, if someone missed a job opportunity, they may imagine scenarios 
where they had gotten the job and how their life would have been different.

It may have positve or negative influences to our mood. <br />
Upward counterfactual thinking (comparing a current outcome with something 
better) is associated with dissatisfation. <br />
Downward counterfactual thinking (comparing a current outcome with less favourable
ones) is associated with positive feelings.

##### 3. Thought Suppression

This involves efforts to keep thoughts out of our consciousness. Through a monitoring
system and an operating process. The two, do work together.

Except when people are tired, experience information overload or are emotional.

It might sometimes cause a rebound effect, where suppressing the thoughts
actually lead to thinking more about it. For example, a person with a drinking 
problem, attempting to suppress their thoughts, may be unsuccessful and lead
them to think about drinking more.

##### Limits on our ability of think about the social world

Our thinking influenced by magical thinking. It is when a person believes that
specific words, thoughts, emotions or rituals can influence the external world.

Two principles of magic thinking are the idea that the physical world can be 
influenced by our thoughts and the *law of similarity* that objects that 
resemble one another share basic properities.

##### Affect and Cognition
###### 1. The influence of affect on cognition
2. The influence of cognition on affect

### 4. Humanistic Approach

It offers an alternative for psychoanalysis and behaviorism. 

It emphasized the inherent goodness of people, their free will and their drive 
towards self-actualization.

Focuses on the whole person and the individual's subjective experience.

#### Core Priniciples
1. **Holism:** Views a person's behavior as an intergrated whole rather than 
isolated parts.
2. **Human Agency:** Views people as creatures that have free will and their
personal responsibility in shaping one's life. People are not puppets of their
unconscious or their environment.
3. **Innate Goodness:** Assumes that humans are inherently good and strive towards
positive growth and fulfilment.
4. **Self-Actualization:** The innate drive to realize one's full potential and
become the best version of oneself.
5. **Subjective Experience:** Values an individual unique perspective and 
interpretation of the world. It emphasizes understanding the person from their
own field of view.
6. **Focus on the present:** While acknowledging the past, it primarily 
focuses on the present moment and the individual's current experiences.

#### Key Figures and Theories

1. **Abraham Maslow:** Known for his Hierachy of needs. It proposes that basic needs
need to be met before higher-level needs (esteem, self-actualization). 
2. **Carl Rogers:** Developed person-centered therapy which emphasizes on empathy, 
genuineness and unconditional positive regard from the therapist to the client. <br />
It creates a safe and positive environment for clients to explore their feelings
and work towards self-discovery.
3. **Rolly May:** He explored themes of anxiety, freedom and search for meaning 
in life. He emphasized the importance of confronting existential questions and 
taking responsibility for one's choices.
4. **Viktor Frankl:** Developed logotherapy. A form of therapy that focuses on 
finding meaning on all forms of existence, even suffering.

### 5. Biopsychology (Behavioral Neuroscience) Neuropsychology

#### Introduction and Overview

Neuropsychology is the study of the impact of damage, disease or malfunctioning 
of the brain on psychological functioning. Psychological impact depends on
several factors e.g 
- age of the person at the time of the injury
- past experience
- nature of the injury

For example, in most people but not all, the parts of the brain controlling 
language are found in the left hemisphere, therefore, damage to this area 
produces disturbances of language(often refered to as aphasia).

Similarly, certain kinds of information about spatial relationships are dealt 
with primarily in the posterior parts of the right hemisphere. 

Since a hemisphere controls the opposite side of the body (left hemisphere control
the right part of the body), lesions (damage) to the right hemisphere result to
hemispatial neglect to left part of the body.

#### Damage to regions of the brain 

Looking at the four main regions on the brian:

##### a. Frontal Lobe

Lesions(damage) on the frontal lobe can produce personality changes and disrupt 
certain forms of planning and organization of behavior.

These changes in personality include:
- apathy
- a failure to excercise foresight
- a tendancy to persist in courses of action that have ceased to be successful
- irritability 
- grandiose
- unrealist ideas

Disinhibitation is a concept to describe the changes that occur. 

> *Disinhibitation refers to the inability to withhold an inappropriate or 
unwanted behavior.*

<Source

/>

By definition, disinhibitation, is saying or doing things on impulse without the 
ussual social contraints and without any apparent thought for the consequences.

##### b. Occipital and Parietal Lobes

Lesions on the occipital and parietal lobes can disrupt visual processes and the 
appreciation of spatial relationships.

##### c. Temporal Lobe

Damage on the temporal lobe, can result to memory impairments.



#### Summary

### 6. Socialcultural Perspective

Highlights the impact of social and cultural factors on behavior and mental
processes. For example, how culture, social norms and interactions shape
individuals.

### 7. Pschodynamic Theory

Developed by Freud, it emphasizes on the role of unconscious drives, early
childhood experiences and intetpersonal relationships in shaping personality 
and behavior.
