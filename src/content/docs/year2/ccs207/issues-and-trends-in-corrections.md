## Privatization in prisons (private prisons)

### Problems with private prisons

- Proponents argue that privatization of prisons enhances efficiency and reduces
costs.
- Critics highlight concerns about profit motives conflicting with rehabilitation
goals.
- Studies suggest private prisons often have higher recidivism rates due to cost
cutting measures that compromise rehabilitation programs.
- Ethical concerns also arise concerning accountability and transparency in
private managed facilities.

### Global Trends on Privatization of Prisons

- Many African coutries suffer from overcrowding and underfunded prisons. South
Africa has experimented with private prisons operate by companies like G4S to
improve conditions and efficiency. However, concerns have araised about profit
motives overshadowing the welfare of inmates.

- Globally, coutries such as United Kindom have embrassed privatization of prisons
and introduced PFI (Private Finance Initiative) to improve conditions and reduce
costs.

## Recidivism prevention

### Theoretical Underpinning of Recidivism

Recidivism prevention is concerned with helping juveniles and adult criminals 
from criminal and violent behavior.

Tradtionally, punitive measures were used, however, research shows that these
measures don't reduce reoffending.

Therefore, to prevent recidivism, a concept of *desistence* is used, which means

> *The process of abstaining from crime among those who previously had engaged in
sustained patterns of offending.*

Desisting can be done in two ways:
1. It can **naturally occur**, either through aging, maturation, marriage and/or
strengthened ties with the society.
2. It can be **encouraged or induced** through deliberate interventions that target
criminogenic and recidivist risk factors among offenders.

### Strategies used in recidivism prevention

1. **Surveillance:** Interventions in this catergory are based on the idea that
closer monitoring of the juvenile will inhibit(hinder) reoffending. It is aimed
at increasing the level of contact and supervision.

2. **Deterrence:** Interventions in this catergory attempt to deter youth from 
offending by dramatizing the negative consequences of that behavior.

3. **Discipline:** These interventions teach youth to learn discipline in order
to succeed in life and avoid reoffending. This is ussually used in boot camps.

4. **Restorative Programs:** These programs are aimed repairing the harm done 
by delinquents by requiring some compensation to victims or reparations via
community service. This may also involve direct reconcililation between victims
and offenders.

5. **Counselling and its variants:** The programs approach is charaterized by a
personal relationship between the offender and an adult who attempts to exercise
influence in the juvenile's feelings, cognition and behavior. Family members and 
peers can take this relationship.

6. **Skill building programs:** These programs provide instructions, practise,
incentives and other such activities aimed at developing skills that help them
control their behavior and participate in normative prosocial functions.

    For example,
    - behavioral programs (behavior managment, contingency contracting, token
    economies and other programs that reward select behaviors)
    - cognitive behavioral therapy
    - social skill training
    - challenge programs (interventions that provide opportunities for experimental
    learning by mastering difficult or stressful tasks)
    - academic training and job related interventions.



## Use of Technology in Prison

##### 1. Enhance Gate and Perimeter Security

Perimeter detection systems that integrate thermal cameras, movement sensors,
access control and mapping can help detect attempts to breach prison walls. Also
drones can be used as part of perimeter patrol.

##### 2. Scanners

Body scanners, an improvement of metal detectors, can be used in prisons and high
risk sites which give an accurate picture of concealments. They are also ideal for
prison entrances and exits.

##### 3. Fire Protecting and Safety

The prison infrastructure should be build with compartmentalization in mind to
prevent fire spreading.

In case of a fire, there should be alarms to alert everyone in prison of the fire
and there should be designated areas of for fire assembly points. 

##### 4. Staff and Inmate Monitoring

With technologies such as
- RFID tags
- video analytics
- personal radios
- body-worn cameras
- man-down sensors
- mapping and access control data
can be used to monitor the location of the staff and movement of inmates for
safety of any security incidents.

##### 5. Automated Procedures

Video analytics and workflow solutions are technologies that can automate key 
procedures - from cell searches to security checks for visiting hours. This 
alleviates staff pressure and can prevent unnecessary guard/inmate friction.

For example, the automatic dispatch of guards when a specific group of inmates
in a specific area exceeds a certain number.
