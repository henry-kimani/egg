Human rights are fundamental rights and freedoms that every person is entitiled

justice for all individuals regardless of their nationality, ethnicity, gender

emergency or the case of imprisonment after a fair tria.

economic, social or cultural cannot be ranked in a hierarchy and must be addressed
as a whole and enjoyed as a bundle.

4. **Interdependent and Interrelatedness:** This means that the enjoyment of one
right depends on the fulfilment of others.

lives.

7. **Accountability and Rule of Law:** Governments must be held accountable for
the protection and promotion of human rights which include having legal frameworks

## Transfer of prisoners

## Prison Subculture

This refers to the distinct set of norms, values, attitude, beliefs, tradition,
language and social structures that emerge among inmates within the environment
of the correctional institution.

### Theories of prison subculture

#### 1. Importation Theory

Inmate bring pre-existing values, norms, social role and charateristics into the 
institution. The prison sub-culture is a reflection of the cultures the inmates 
came.

#### 2. Indigenous Prison Culture and Exportation Theory

Also known as the deprivation model, it argues that sub-culture arises in 
response to harsh depriving conditions(pains of imprisonment). This forces an 
inmate to create their own social system and values to adopt and survive.

The pains of imprisonment center on five general areas of deprivation.
- Loss of liberty.
- Loss of readily goods and services from the society.
- Loss of heterosexual relationships, both sexual and non-sexual.
- Loss of autonomy.
- Loss of personal security.
