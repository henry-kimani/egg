## Definition and Overview

Sentencing is the process by which a court imposes a penal sanction once an
accused person has pleaded guilty or has been convicted for an offense.

The punishments are outline on Section 24 of the Kenyan Penal Code, which 
provide wide discretionary powers for Judges and Magistrates, enabling the court
to determine the most suitable sentence for each individual offender.

Sentencing involves two-stage decision making process.

The initial decision is made as to whether to grant custodial or non-custodial
sentence. This is based on **pre-sentence investigation** i.e a thorough file
including the background information of the offender.

The second decision involves determinig the length of the sentence. For judges
deciding this, they consider several factors,
1. The most important being the seriousness of the crime.
2. The next considered factor is the prior record of the offender. The worse the 
prior record, the more likely the offender will receive a lengthy sentence.
3. Other factors include Mitigating and Aggravating circumstances.

## Models of sentensing

### 1. Indeterminate

This is sentencing that includes a range of years that will be potentially served
by the offender.

The offender is released in the minimum and maximum range of years which is 
determined by factors such as offender behavior and offender work ethic. This 
discretion is assigned to the department of corrections.

Once the offender has served a minimum portion of their sentence, they are informed
fo potential parole legibility.

### 2. Determinate

It consists of fixed periods of incarceration with no later flexibility in the
term that is served. 

Offender are imprisoned for a specific period and once that time is expired, they
are release from prision. While in prison, they might be given "good time" which
is earned through:
- a willingness to work in prison,
- enagage in educational and therapeutic programs 
- participate in other prosocial activies.

Good time earned is taken off from the total sentence allowing offenders to be
released from prison early.

#### Types of Determinate Sentensing

1. **Determinate presumptive sentence:** It specifies the exact sentence to be 
served by the inmate.

2. **Determinate discretionary sentence:** Sets a stated range of time that must be
served. For example, a sentence of 3 - 5 years, the judge determines the exact
sentence which is between the stated range.<br />
Hence the name. Determinate because its fixed and discretionary because it give 
the judge freedom to choose a sentence that is within a range.


### 3. Mandatory Minimum Sentense

It requires that some amount of minimum sentence to be served by offenders of 
specific crimes e.g drug dealers.

Considerations such as offender's background or circumstances and use of 
community-based sanctions are out of question. The sentence imposed should not
be lower than what is prescribed.

However, Section 332 (2) Criminal Procedure Code, obligates the court to take
into account the time already served in custody. 

Failure to do so, may result to punishment that is not proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence.
