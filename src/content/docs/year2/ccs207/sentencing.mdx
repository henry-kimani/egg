## Definition and Overview

Sentencing is the process by which a court imposes a penal sanction once an
accused person has pleaded guilty or has been convicted for an offense.

The punishments are outline on Section 24 of the Kenyan Penal Code, which 
provide wide discretionary powers for Judges and Magistrates, enabling the court
to determine the most suitable sentence for each individual offender.

Sentencing involves two-stage decision making process.

The initial decision is made as to whether to grant custodial or non-custodial
sentence. This is based on **pre-sentence investigation** i.e a thorough file
including the background information of the offender.

The second decision involves determinig the length of the sentence. For judges
deciding this, they consider several factors,
1. The most important being the seriousness of the crime.
2. The next considered factor is the prior record of the offender. The worse the 
prior record, the more likely the offender will receive a lengthy sentence.
3. Other factors include Mitigating and Aggravating circumstances.

## Models of sentensing

### 1. Indeterminate

This is sentencing that includes a range of years that will be potentially served
by the offender.

The offender is released in the minimum and maximum range of years which is 
determined by factors such as offender behavior and offender work ethic. This 
discretion is assigned to the department of corrections.

Once the offender has served a minimum portion of their sentence, they are informed
fo potential parole legibility.

### 2. Determinate

It consists of fixed periods of incarceration with no later flexibility in the
term that is served. 

Offender are imprisoned for a specific period and once that time is expired, they
are release from prision. While in prison, they might be given "good time" which
is earned through:
- a willingness to work in prison,
- enagage in educational and therapeutic programs 
- participate in other prosocial activies.

Good time earned is taken off from the total sentence allowing offenders to be
released from prison early.

#### Types of Determinate Sentensing

1. **Determinate presumptive sentence:** It specifies the exact sentence to be 
served by the inmate.

2. **Determinate discretionary sentence:** Sets a stated range of time that must be
served. For example, a sentence of 3 - 5 years, the judge determines the exact
sentence which is between the stated range.<br />
Hence the name. Determinate because its fixed and discretionary because it give 
the judge freedom to choose a sentence that is within a range.


### 3. Mandatory Minimum Sentense

It requires that some amount of minimum sentence to be served by offenders of 
specific crimes e.g drug dealers.

Considerations such as offender's background or circumstances and use of 
community-based sanctions are out of question. The sentence imposed should not
be lower than what is prescribed.

However, Section 332 (2) Criminal Procedure Code, obligates the court to take
into account the time already served in custody. 

Failure to do so, may result to punishment that is not proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence. 

## Sentencing Guidelines in Kenya

These guidelines aim to standardize the sentencing process and proceedures in all
Kenya's criminal courts and provide a framework which Magistrates and Judges can
exercise in their discretion in a manner which is:
- objective
- accoutable 
- transparent
- proportionate
- consistent
- respectful of the human rights.

Also, they aim to enhance coordination of all agencies involved in the sentencing
process as well as supervision of the sentence passed.


## Principles underpining the Sentensing Process

#### 1. Proportionality

The sentence imposed should be proportionate to the offending behavior. This
means it should not be more or less that is deserved in view of the gravity of 
the offence.

Proportionality is weighted in view of the actual, foreseeable and intented 
impact of the offense as well as the responsibility of the offender.

#### 2. Equality/Uniformity/Consistency

The same sentences should be imposed for same offences committed by offenders in
similar circumstances.

#### 3. Accoutability and Transparency

The reasoning behind the determination of the sentence should be clear and in
accordance with the law and the sentencing principles laid out in these
guidelines.

#### 4. Inlusiveness

Both the offender and the victim should participate in and inform the sentencing
process.

#### 5. Totality of the sentence

The sentence passed for offenders convicted for multiple counts must be just and
proportionate, taking into account the offending behavior as a whole.

#### 6. Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms

The sentences imposed should promote and not undermine human rights and fundamental
freedoms and uphold the dignity of both the offender and the victim.


## Objectives of Sentensing

1. **Retribution:** To punish the offender for thier criminal conduct in a just
manner.
2. **Deterrence:** To deter the offender from committing a similar or any offence
in the future as well as discourage the public from committing crime.
3. **Rehabilitation:** To enable the offender to reform from his/her criminal
disposition and become a law-abiding citizen.
4. **Restorative Justice:** To address the losses and damages incurred by the 
victims or the community and promote a sense of responsibility through the offender's
contribution towards meeting those needs.
5. **Community Protection:** To protect the community from by removing the offender
from the community and therefore avoiding further perpectuation of the offender's
criminal acts.
6. **Denunciation:** To clearly communicate the community's condemnation of the 
criminal act.
7. **Reconciliation:** To mend the relationship between the offender, the victim
and the community.
8. **Reintegration:** To facilitate the re-entry of the offender into the society.

the CPC prohibits the imposition of death penalty upon offenders convicted for
an offense punishable by death, but was committed when the offender was below 18
years. Such an offender is detained at the President's pleasure.

## Process of Sentensing

#### 1. Step 1: Determining the Sentensing range

Start by defining the statutory maximum ,minimum or both.

Look at the case law. Has the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court issued 
any judgements that maybe relevant to sentencing?

Provide the prosecution and the defense opportunity to address the law.

#### 2. Step 2: Determining the level of seriousness

There are four levels of seriousness, Very High, High, Medium and Low.

To determine the seriousness level, the court assess both **culpability of the 
offender** and **harm caused the offending behavior**. This information comes 
from:
- evidence that was adduced during the trial
- where there has been a plea
- from the prosecution summary of facts and victim statements
- defense submissions

#### 3. Step 3: Determining culpability and harm

The victim impact statement is a source to determine the level of harm, however,
it may not always be availed to the court, since not all victims wish to make 
such a statement and they should not be forced to.

#### 4. Step 4: Determining the bandwith of sentence

The four bandwiths are considered, red being the most serious and blue the least

  <div class="bg-red-400">
    <span>Harm</span>
  </div>

  <div class="!m-0 bg-blue-400">
    <span>Culpability</span>
  </div>
</div>

5. Step 5: Consider additional information.
6. Step 6: Determine the sentence.
7. Step 7: Apply any reduction for a guilty plea
8. Step 8: Consider the totality of the sentence.
9. Step 9: Announce the Sentence and give reasons.
10. Step 10: Give consideration for time spent in custody.
