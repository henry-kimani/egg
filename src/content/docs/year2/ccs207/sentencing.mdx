## Definition and Overview

Sentencing is the process by which a court imposes a penal sanction once an
accused person has pleaded guilty or has been convicted for an offense.

The punishments are outlined on Section 24 of the Kenyan Penal Code, which 
provide wide discretionary powers for Judges and Magistrates, enabling the court
to determine the most suitable sentence for each individual offender.

Sentencing involves two-stage decision making process.

The initial decision is made as to whether to grant custodial or non-custodial
sentence. This is based on **pre-sentence investigation** i.e through file a
including the background information of the offender.

The second decision involves determinig the length of the sentence. For judges
deciding this, they consider several factors,
1. The most important being the seriousness of the crime.
2. The next considered factor is the prior record of the offender. The worse the 
prior record, the more likely the offender will receive a lengthy sentence.
3. Other factors include Mitigating and Aggravating circumstances.

## Models of sentensing

### 1. Indeterminate

This is sentencing that includes a range of years that will be potentially served
by the offender.

The offender is released in the minimum and maximum range of years which is 
determined by factors such as offender behavior and offender work ethic. This 
discretion is assigned to the department of corrections.

Once the offender has served a minimum portion of their sentence, they are informed
fo potential parole legibility.

### 2. Determinate

It consists of fixed periods of incarceration with no later flexibility in the
term that is served. 

Offenders are imprisoned for a specific period and once that time is expired, they
are release from prision. While in prison, they might be given "good time" which
is earned through:
- a willingness to work in prison,
- enagage in educational and therapeutic programs 
- participate in other prosocial activities.

Good time earned is taken off from the total sentence allowing offenders to be
released from prison early.

#### Types of Determinate Sentensing

1. **Determinate presumptive sentence:** It specifies the exact sentence to be 
served by the inmate.

2. **Determinate discretionary sentence:** Sets a stated range of time that must be
served. For example, a sentence of 3 - 5 years, the judge determines the exact
sentence which is between the stated range.<br />
Hence the name. Determinate because its fixed and discretionary because it gives
the judge freedom to choose a sentence that is within a range.


### 3. Mandatory Minimum Sentense

It requires that some amount of minimum sentence to be served by offenders of 
specific crimes e.g drug dealers.

Considerations such as offender's background or circumstances and use of 
community-based sanctions are out of question. The sentence imposed should not
be lower than what is prescribed.

However, Section 332 (2) Criminal Procedure Code, obligates the court to take
into account the time already served in custody. 

Failure to do so, may result to punishment that is not proportionate to the 
seriousness of the offence. 

## Sentencing Guidelines in Kenya

These guidelines aim to standardize the sentencing process and proceedures in all
Kenya's criminal courts and provide a framework which Magistrates and Judges can
exercise in their discretion in a manner which is:
- objective
- accoutable 
- transparent
- proportionate
- consistent
- respectful of the human rights.

Also, they aim to enhance coordination of all agencies involved in the sentencing
process as well as supervision of the sentence passed.


## Principles underpining the Sentensing Process

#### 1. Proportionality

The sentence imposed should be proportionate to the offending behavior. This
means it should not be more or less that is deserved in view of the gravity of 
the offence.

Proportionality is weighted in view of the actual, foreseeable and intented 
impact of the offense as well as the responsibility of the offender.

#### 2. Equality/Uniformity/Consistency

The same sentences should be imposed for same offences committed by offenders in
similar circumstances.

#### 3. Accoutability and Transparency

The reasoning behind the determination of the sentence should be clear and in
accordance with the law and the sentencing principles laid out in these
guidelines.

#### 4. Inlusiveness

Both the offender and the victim should participate in and inform the sentencing
process.

#### 5. Totality of the sentence

The sentence passed for offenders convicted for multiple counts must be just and
proportionate, taking into account the offending behavior as a whole.

#### 6. Respect for Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms

The sentences imposed should promote and not undermine human rights and fundamental
freedoms and uphold the dignity of both the offender and the victim.


## Objectives of Sentensing

1. **Retribution:** To punish the offender for thier criminal conduct in a just
manner.
2. **Deterrence:** To deter the offender from committing a similar or any offence
in the future as well as discourage the public from committing crime.
3. **Rehabilitation:** To enable the offender to reform from his/her criminal
disposition and become a law-abiding citizen.
4. **Restorative Justice:** To address the losses and damages incurred by the 
victims or the community and promote a sense of responsibility through the offender's
contribution towards meeting those needs.
5. **Community Protection:** To protect the community from by removing the offender
from the community and therefore avoiding further perpectuation of the offender's
criminal acts.
6. **Denunciation:** To clearly communicate the community's condemnation of the 
criminal act.
7. **Reconciliation:** To mend the relationship between the offender, the victim
and the community.
8. **Reintegration:** To facilitate the re-entry of the offender into the society.

## Types of Penal Sanctions used in Kenya

### Death Penalty

It is imposed for offenders convicted for:
- treason
- administration of unlawful oaths to commit capital offences 
- robbery with violence or attempted robbery with violence
- murder

The mode of punishment recognized in Kenya for death sentences according to
Section 69, Prisions Act, is hanging. However, the last execution took place in
1987.

Children in conflict with the law, cannot be subjected to death penalty. Further,
the CPC prohibits the imposition of death penalty upon offenders convicted for
an offense punishable by death, but was committed when the offender was below 18
years. Such an offender is detained at the President's pleasure.

Pregnant offenders cannot be subjected to death sentence and where the offense is
punishable by death, they are imprisoned for lift instead.

### Imprisonment

The penal code in most cases uses "...liable to... imprisonment" to state applicable
custodial sentence or "not exceeding ..." to set out a maximum sentence.

Custodial sentence should be reserved for offenses so serious that neither a fine
or a community service can be justified.

Imprisonment of petty offenders should be avoided, as the rehabilitative objective 
of sentencing is rarely met when offenders serve short sentences in custody.

Factors considered when determining either custodial or non-custodial sentence:

##### 1. Gravity of the Offense

Gravity of the offense considers the nature and the circumstances of the crime.
If the circumstances are not aggravating (more serious), then a non-custodial 
sentence should be considered.

##### 2. Criminal history of the offender

First offenders, should be considered for non-custodial sentence.

For repeat offenders, consider the nature of the previous behavior and the time
elapsed between the previous conviction and the current offense.

For adult offenders, previous convictions that relate to the offenses 
committed when they were a child, should be disregared, unless the circumstances
of the case demand they be taken into account because of the similarity or 
frequency of the behavior or the seriousness of the previous offense.

##### 3. Children in conflit with the law

For children in conflict with the law, non-custodial sentences should be a matter
of course. The exception being the court consideres that a custodial sentence is 
the most appropriate and would be in the child's best interest. <br />
This course of action should be the last resort.

##### 4. Conduct of the offender

Non-custodial sentences are best suited for offenders who are already remorseful
and receptive to rehabilitative measures.

##### 5. Protection of the community

With evidence that the offender is more likely to pose a threat to the community,
a custodial sentence is more appropriate. 

The probation officer should inform the 
court the risk posed by the offender to the community.

##### 6. Offender's responsibility to third parties

Imposing a custodial sentence, should consider if they are vulnerable persons who
depend on them in light of the nature and seriousness of the crime.

Also, if the objectives of the sentencing would be met with a non-custodial 
sentence or a suspended sentence.

### Community Service Orders

It is a non-custodial sentence that entails doing upaid public work for the benefit 
of the community and for a period that does not exceed the term of the imprisonment
that the offender could have been sentenced.

In suitable cases, they are effective as they promote a sense of responsibility
to the offender as they contribute to the society. Especially for offenders how 
find it demeaning to serve sentence publicly.

If supervised properly it achieves the objectives of sentencing and courts should
impose it where most appropriate.

According to the Community Service Order Act, it is the probation officer, to 
identify suitable work placements and to oversee the work and progress of the 
offenders.

### Probation Order

A probation order places the offender under the supervision of a probation officer
for not less that six months and not exceeding three years.

An offender enters a recognizance(bond), with or without sureties and is required 
to comply strictly with it as any breach of the order will attract a range of 
sanctions outlined in the Probation of Offenders Act.

Factors considered when placing a probation order:

1. Age
2. Character
3. Antecedents
4. Home surroundings
5. Health and Mental condition of the Offender
6. The nature of the offense
7. The victim impact statement
8. Any extenuating circumstances in which the offense was committed

| Agency | Institution| Age | Primary Legislation |
|--------| -----------|-----|---------------------|
| Department of  children services | Rehabilitation school | 12 - to below 16 years | Children's Act 2022 |
| Probation and aftercare services | Hostel | 12 and above | Probation of Offenders Act CAP 64 |
| Kenya Prisons Service | Borstal institution | 15 - 17 years | Borstal Institution Act Cap 93 |
||Youth Corretive Training Center | 17 - 21 years| Prisons Act Cap 90 |

### Fines

Fines are permitted in relevant provisions and may be imposed in **addition to**
or in **substitution of**.

However, where a minimum sentence of imprisonment if provided, a fine must not be
imposed in substitution.

### Payment of compensation

Compensation orders fuse restorative and retributive justice. 

Payment of compensation, gives an offender and opportunity to take responsibility
of their conduct and remedy the harm caused. 

For example, a person convicted of
corruption or an economic crime that occasioned lose to anyone, it is mandatory
for the court to impose compensation orders, upon conviction or on subsequent 
application.

### Forfeiture

It refers to the court's power to confiscate (take) the accused property as part
of a sentence. Therefore, the offender is unable to benefit from their criminality.
An order of forfeiture complements the other form of punishment.

The Anti-Corruption and Economic's Crime Act serve as a strong general deterrence.

Orders of forfeiture raise revenue that can be used to enhance the response of 
crime such as equipping and upskilling investigations of serious crimes e.g 
terrorism.

### Find the security to keep peace and be of good behavior

For offenses other than capital offenses or offenses that require a mandatory
minimum sentence, a convict can enter a recognizance, with or without sureties,
to keep the peace and be of good behavior.

This is useful for dealing with petty offenders and suitable, where in the opinion
of the court, the offender takes his recognizance seriously or where the sureties
are able to influence the offender to adhere to the order.

### Absolute and Conditional discharge

According to the Penal Code (CAP 63), Section 35:

1. An offender my be released absolutely or conditionally, if they have regard to the circumstances
including the nature of the offense and the character of the offender, that it is
not suitable to inflict punishment or a probation order under the Probation of
Offenders Act (CAP 64).

2. The court will explain to the offender in a language they understand, that if
they commit another offense during the period of conditional discharge, they shall
be liable and sentence of the original offense.

3. If the order of a discharge is made, the court may order them to pay the whole, 
any part or a small part to the prosecution of any compensation adjudged under
section 31.

The period of conditional discharge cannot exceed 12 months.

/>

### Suspended Sentenses

It is a legal arrangement in which a person who is found guity is not sentenced 
but maybe sentenced for that crime at a future time if they commit another 
offense during a specific period.

Section 15 CPC, allows the court to impose it for sentences not more that 2 years.
If the offender doesn't commit an offense during the fixed period of time, the
sentence does not take effect. 

Otherwise, the sentence takes effect and the 
sentence for the second offense runs consecutively (following one another) with
the original sentence.

### Restitution

It is the return or restoration of something to its rightful owner or original 
status, compensation for the wrong done to another or making amends for the loss
caused to another.

Section 178, Criminal Procedure Code mandates the court to make orders for 
restitution in respect to the stolen property.

### Suspension of certificate of compentency in traffic offences

From Section 39, Penal Code, a person convicted of an offense connected to driving
a motor vehicle, the court can:
- suspend a driving license for a fixed period of time
- cancel the license and disqualify the person from obtaining another driving 
license permanently or for fixed period of time.

When a court makes such an ordered, it is required to endorse(sign) the certificate
with particulars (detailes) of the conviction and the order, and forward the same
to the Inspector General of National Police Service and the Director General of 
NTSA.

### Police supervision

Section 18 of the Security Laws (Ammendment) Act amends the Criminal Procedure 
Code and gives the court powers to order police service supervision of an offender 
for a period not exceeding five years upon release from custody in certain
circumstances.

### Revocation/forfeiture of licences

## Process of Sentensing

#### Step 1: Determining the Sentensing range

Start by defining the statutory maximum ,minimum or both.

Look at the case law. Has the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court issued 
any judgements that maybe relevant to sentencing?

Provide the prosecution and the defense opportunity to address the law.

#### Step 2: Determining the level of seriousness

There are four levels of seriousness, Very High, High, Medium and Low.

To determine the seriousness level, the court assess both **culpability of the 
offender** and **harm caused the offending behavior**. This information comes 
from:
- evidence that was adduced during the trial
- where there has been a plea
- from the prosecution summary of facts and victim statements
- defense submissions

#### Step 3: Determining culpability and harm

The victim impact statement is a source to determine the level of harm, however,
it may not always be availed to the court, since not all victims wish to make 
such a statement and they should not be forced to.

#### Step 4: Determining the bandwith of sentence

The four bandwiths are considered, red being the most serious and blue the least.

    <td class="bg-blue-400 dark:bg-blue-800"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### Step 5: Consider additional information.

Other factors considered by the court relate to the offenders' personal circumstances,
conduct after the offence, the role the offender played in the offense among others.

The common mitigating factors are:

1. Absense of any relevant/recent convictions.
2. Is there evidence of the accused's good character.
3. Has the accused demonstrated or expressed remorse by evidence e.g cooperation
with authorities, apology, reconciliation.
4. Was there minimal or no planning involved in the commission of the offence?
5. If acting with others, was the accused in a lesser or subordinate role or the
accused perform a limited role under the direction of others.
6. Did the offender become involved through coercion, intimidation or exploitation.
7. Did the accused have a limited awareness or understanding of the offence.
8. Has there been delay arrest and conviction.
9. Was the conduct initially legitimate but evolved into an illegal conduct.
10. Is the accused a sole or primary caretaker of dependent relatives.
11. Evidence of disability or serious medical condition urgent, intensive or 
long term treatment.
12. Mental disability or disorder.

#### Step 6: Determine the sentence.

Taking into account the above factors, the court will determine the applicable
sentence.

#### Step 7: Apply any reduction for a guilty plea

#### Step 8: Consider the totality of the sentence.

Courts punishing more that one offence, should give a total sentence which reflects
all the offending behaviour such that its just and proportionate.

#### Step 9: Announce the Sentence and give reasons.

The court should give reasons for its decision, identifying the particular aggravating
and mitigating features it has taken into account and explain the effects of the
sentence.

#### Step 10: Give consideration for time spent in custody.

The court must give credit to time spent in custody pending the determination of
the sentence and deduct the period from the sentence to be served.
