## Definition

They are essential components of a nation's strategic framework which involve 
identifying, evaluating and prioritizing potential risks to the stability
sovereignity and well-being of the state and its citizens.

### 1. Threat Perception

Refers to the subjective evaluation of factors that may challenge a nation's security

### 2. National Security Assessment

It involves analyzing potential threats and vulnerabilities across various 
domains. These domains include:

#### a. Military Threats

- External aggressions such as invasions or territorial disputes.
- Arms race dynamics or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).
- Hostile actions by non-state actors (e.g terrorist groups)

#### b. Economic Threats

- Economic santions, trade wars or disruptions to critical supply chains.
- Cyber-attacks targeting financial institutions or critical industries.
- Overdependence of foreign powers for strategic resource.

#### c. Cyber-security Threats

- Attacks on digital infrastructure, such as data breaches or critical system
disruptions.
- Cyber espionage by foreign states or entities.
- Information warfare and the spread of disinformation.

#### d. Environmental and Climate Threats

- Natural disasters exacerbated by climate change e.g floods, drought
- Competition over gradually diminishing natural resource e.g water, arable land
- Rising sea-levels affecting coastal populations.

#### e. Social and Political Threats

- Internal instability from political polarilization or civil unrest.
- Rise of extremism or radical ideologies.
- Weakening of democratic institutions or governance strucuture.

#### f. Health and Biosecurity Threats

- Pandemics or outbreaks of infectious diseases.
- Bioterrorism or accidental release of harmful pathogens.
- Strains on healthcare systems due to emerging global health challenges.

### 3. Factors Influecing Threat Perception

- **Leadership and Ideology:** How political leaders define and prioritize threats.
- **Media and Public opinion:** The role of information dissemination in shaping
perceptions.
- **International Alliances:** Cooperations with organizations like NATO or the 
UN can influence perceived threats.
- **Technological Advancements:** New technologies can create both opprotunties
and vulnerabilities.

### 4. Framework of Threat assessment

1. **Risk Identification:** Cataloging potential threats across domains.
2. **Likelyhood Evaluation:** Assessing the probability of threats materializing
3. **Impact Analysis:** Estimating the severity of consequences if a threat occurs.
4. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Identifying weakeness in national systems and 
strategies.
5. **Prioritization:** Allocating resources to address the most critical threats.

### 5. Evolving Trends in Threat Perception

- **Shift from traditional to non-tradtional threats:** Nations are increasingly
focusing on hybrid walfare, cyber-threats and climate induced risks.
- **Global Interdependence:** Economic and technological globalization makes
countries more interconnected and consequently, more vulnerable.
- **Emergence of asymmetric threats:** Non-state actors and unconventional tactics
pose significant challanges to traditional security paradigms.

### 6. Addressing Threats: Strategic responses

- **Stregthening Defense Mechanisms:** Enhancing military, cyber and intelligence
capabilities.
- **Diplomatic Engagement:** Fostering alliances and resolving disputes through
dialogue.
- **Public Resilience:** Building societal awareness and preparedness for crises.
- **Technological Innvoation:** Leveraging advancements to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Policy Adaptation:** Regularly updating national security strategies to 
reflect emerging risks.
