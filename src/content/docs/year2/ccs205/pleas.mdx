## General Provisions relating to Autrefois Aquit and Autrefois Convict

### Plea of Autrefois Aquit

The fundamental principle of law that a man may not be put to jerpody twice, for
the same offense.

The terms means that, that if a man has been tried and the trial found not guilty
of an offense by court, the acquittal is abar to accused charge to the same offense.

This is important since:
1. It prevents the state from repeated prosecution.
2. It protects an individual from stress and abuse of power.
3. It brings finality to the legal process.

### Autrefois Convict

Rule of double jerpody: <br />
Applies to equal if not more force to conviction. Test is not whether facts relied
upon into trials are same, but whether the accused have been convicted of an offense
which is same to that subsequently charged.

Essentially, if a person is tried and found guilty and have been convicted, they
cannot be tried again for the same offense.

This is important as: 
1. It stops the prosecution from imposing multiple sentences on the same offense.
2. It adheres to the principle of, once a dept is paid, it cannot be paid again.

## Objection to jurisdiction

It is a legal challenge arguing that the court lack authority to hear a case or 
make a decision, meaning its not the appropriate body to deal with the specific
dispute. 

This is whether because of the subject matter, the parties involved or 
the geographical location of the dispute.

## Change of plea

> A change of plea is a guilty plea in a criminal case. It is refered to as a "change"
because the defendant had plead "not guilty" to the charged during the previous
proceedings, usually during the post indictment arraignment and now has decided 
to plead guity to the charges instead of going to trial.

## Retraction of plea

of concessions. Such concessions include:
1. Reduced charges

allows for resource management so that prosecutors can focus on more serious 
cases.

1. After consoltation with the police investigation the case.
2. Due regard the nature and circumstances relating to the offenses, personal
circumstances of the accused.
