## Decision to Prosecute

The decision to prosecute by the DPP, is gorvened by two principles
1. Evidential Test (most critical)
2. Public Interest Test

### Evidential Test

Prosecutors must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to provide a 
realist prospect of conviction against the accused. The prosecutor must:

1. Read the complaint.
2. Read the witness statements recorded.
3. Consider documentary evidence and other materials that can support credible

In testing the evidence available, he/she must adhere to the two principles of 
evidence:
1. **Admissibility of the evidence:** The prosecutor should assess:
- Admissibility of the evidence under existing law and procedure e.g the Evidence
Act.
- The likelyhood of the evidence being held as inadmissible by the court.

2. **Relevancy of the evidence:** The prosecutor should assess if the evidence
tends to prove or disprove an element of an offense or added probative value to
make one of the elements more likely or not.

### Public Interest Test

When a case does not support the Evidential Test, prosecution is not inevitable.
They must employ a further test (complex one), and demands for prosecutor's 
highest professional judgement and keen awareness of the social and political 
environment within which any prosecution must be conducted.

The DPP will consider: (under the public interest)

1. Whether offense committed involved offensive weapons, actual violence or a 
breach of peace.
2. Whether the offense was against a law enforcement officer, public servant of
a provider of essential services.
3. Whether suspects owns a position of trust such that his prosecutions displays
a bad presidence.
4. Whether the suspect is a kingpin, leader or organizer of crime.
5. Whether a victim was a child, person with disability or vulnerable of age or 
mental capacity.
6. Whether the offense was motivated by discrimination e.g tribe, education, height
race etc.
7. Whether the suspect is a habitual offender who is left free.
8. Whether the offense is technique committed on basis of ignorance.
9. Whether there has been on dew delay between the commission of the offense 
and pretend prosecution.
