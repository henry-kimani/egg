### Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design

CPTED is a concept to help us better understand the relationship between design
and human behavior.

CPTED is a proactive approach to manipulate the physical environment and bring
about the desired behavior of reduced criminal activity as well as reduced fear
of crime.

### Environment

CPTED concept states that the physical environment can be manipulated to produce
behavioral effects that will reduce the incidence and fear of crime. 
These behavioral effects can be achived by reducing the 
[propensity](https://www.google.com/search?q=propensity) of the physical 
environment to support criminal behavior.

Environment in CPTED, includes the people and their physical and social surroundings.

The term design includes physical, social, management and law enforcement directives
that seek to affect positively human behavior as people interact with physical 
environment.

CPTED does not seek to prevent various universal crimes, rather seeks solutions
limited to variables that can be manipulated and evaluated in the specified 
human/environment relationship.

It involves:
- design of the physical space in the context of legitimate users of the space
(physical, social and psychological needs)
- the normal and expected use of space(the activity or absence of the activity
planned for the space).
- and the predictable behavior of both legitimate users and offenders.

Therefore, CPTED is proper, if it recognizes the designated use of space, defines
the crime problem incidental to and the solution compatible to the designated
use, and incorporates the crime prevention strategies that enhance the effective
use of that space.

### Space

The continuum of space within a residential complex - a property consisting of 
one or more buildings for residential use - can be divided into four categories.

1. **Public**

    It space perceived by all members of the residential area or 
    neighborhood as belonging to the public as a whole, which a stranger has a 
    perceived right to use.

2. **Semipublic** 

    Space accessible by all members of the public without passing through a
    locked or guarded barrier. There is ought to be implied license use by the
    public, and strangers are rarely challenged.

3. **Semiprivate**

    Space restricted for use of residents, guests and service 
    people on legitimate assignments. In multifamily, this is ussually secured by
    protection officers, locks or other forms of physical barriers. Strangers can
    be expcted to be challenged as trespassers.

4. **Private**

    Space restricted for use of residents of a single dwelling unit,
    their invited guests and service people, with access controlled by locks or
    physical barriers.

### CPTED strategies

Access control and surveillance are the primary design concepts of physical design,
however, they are not mutuall exclusive, meaning certain strategies acheive both.

Access control and surveillance design concepts emphasized mechanical or organized
crime prevention techniques while overlooking attitudes, motivation and use of the
physical environment.

Therefore, more recent designs have shifted the emphasis to natural crime
prevention techniques, attempting to use natural opportunities presented by the
environment for crime prevetion. This lead to the emphasis of territoriality.

#### Natural Access Control

Access control is a design concept directed primarily at **decreasing crime 
opportunity**. It stragies are classified as:
- organized: e.g security officers
- mechanical: e.g locks, lighting and alarms
- natural: e.g spatial definition

The primary thrust of access control strategy is to deny access to a crime target
and to create a perception of risk in offenders.

#### Natural Surveillance

Surveillance on the otherhand, is directed at **keeping intruders under observation**.
Its stragies are classified as:
- organized: e.g police station
- mechanical: e.g lighting, locks and alarms
- natural: e.g windows.

The primary thrust, is to facilitate observation, although it may have its effect
of an access control strategy by effectively keeping intruders out because of 
increase perception of risk.

#### Territorial Reinforcement

The concept of territoriality suggests that physical design can contribute to a
sense of territoriality. That is, physical design can create or extend a sphere
of influence so that users develop a sense of proprietorship.

Natural access control and surveillance will promote more responsiveness by users
in protecting their territory and promote greater perception of risk by offenders.

### Maintenance

Care and maintenance allow for the continued space for its intented purpose as
well as contributing to territorial reinforcement.

Proper maintenance protects the public health, safety and welfare in all existing
existing, residential and non-residential and all existing premises by establishing
minimum standards, best practises and a master plan.

Furthermore, the effort to achieve a balance btween design for crime prevention
and design for effective use of environments, contributed to a shift from 
organized and mechanical strategies to natural strategies.

This is because natural strategies exploit the opportunities of the given
environment both to naturally and routinely facilitate access control and 
surveillance and to reinforce positive behavior in the use of the environment.

### Benefits of CPTED

In addition to dealing with the reduction of crime and fear problems, other
benefits of CPTED include:

1. **Treatment of crime problems at various environmental scales**

    The CPTED process of:
    - Identifying crime/environment problems
    - Selecting CPTED strategies
    - Initialing, implementing and evaluating them

    can be applied to entire neighborhoods and institutional settings to small
    to a small geographical location.

2. **Intergration of preventiont approaches**

    CPTED strategies are derived from an opportunity model of criminal behavior
    that assumes the offenders behavior can be accounted for by understanding
    how and under what circumstances or variables interact to induce crime.

    Once and assessment of the opportunity structure is made, then appropriate
    strategies can be designed and integrated into a coordinated, consistent
    program.

3. **Identification of short and long-term goals**

    CPTED, like other strategies, have ulitimate goals that can take time to
    implement. However, many fail to develop proximate goals(short-term) and ways
    to measure their success but CPTED can. 

    This is because it includes an evaluation framework that details proximate
    goals relating to increase access control, surveillance and territorial
    reinforcement.

4. **Encouragement of collective responses to problems**

    CPTED emphasizes in increasing the capacity of residents to work together
    rather than individually. The strategies are aimed at fostering citizen
    participation and strengthening social cohesion.

5. **Interdisciplinary approach to urban problems**

    An explicit policy of interdisciplinary teaming ensures effective cooperation
    among diverse city departments such as public works, social services,
    economic development and police etc.

    Each participant benefits from the exposure to the responsibilities, jurisdiction
    and skills of the others.

6. **Encouragement of better police/community responses**

    Since CPTED involves interdisciplinary teaming, it fosters police-community
    relationships, thereby leading to better anticrime programs.

7. **Development of security guidelines and standards**

    CPTED programming can lead to the creation of security cliteria for newly
    constructed or modified environments to avoid planning and design decisions
    that inadvertely provide crime opportunities for crime.

8. **Assistance in urban revitalization**(inspire with new life)

    CPTED can help revitalizating communities including downtown areas. When
    comprehensive effort is underway for reducing crime and fear, the community
    i.e business leaders, investors and other citizens, help invest in it thereby
    improving community identity and cohesiveness.

9. **Acquisition of development funds**

10. **Institutionalization of crime prevention policies and practises**
