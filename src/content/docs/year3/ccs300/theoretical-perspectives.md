### Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design

CPTED is a concept to help us better understand the relationship between design
and human behavior.

CPTED is a proactive approach to manipulate the physical environment and bring
about the desired behavior of reduced criminal activity as well as reduced fear
of crime.

#### Environment

CPTED concept states that the physical environment can be manipulated to produce
behavioral effects that will reduce the incidence and fear of crime. 
These behavioral effects can be achived by reducing the 
[propensity](https://www.google.com/search?q=propensity) of the physical 
environment to support criminal behavior.

Environment in CPTED, includes the people and their physical and social surroundings.

The term design includes physical, social, management and law enforcement directives
that seek to affect positively human behavior as people interact with physical 
environment.

CPTED does not seek to prevent various universal crimes, rather seeks solutions
limited to variables that can be manipulated and evaluated in the specified 
human/environment relationship.

It involves:
- design of the physical space in the context of legitimate users of the space
(physical, social and psychological needs)
- the normal and expected use of space(the activity or absence of the activity
planned for the space).
- and the predictable behavior of both legitimate users and offenders.

Therefore, CPTED is proper, if it recognizes the designated use of space, defines
the crime problem incidental to and the solution compatible to the designated
use, and incorporates the crime prevention strategies that enhance the effective
use of that space.

#### Space

The continuum of space within a residential complex - a property consisting of 
one or more buildings for residential use - can be divided into four categories.

1. **Public**

    It space perceived by all members of the residential area or 
    neighborhood as belonging to the public as a whole, which a stranger has a 
    perceived right to use.

2. **Semipublic** 

    Space accessible by all members of the public without passing through a
    locked or guarded barrier. There is ought to be implied license use by the
    public, and strangers are rarely challenged.

3. **Semiprivate**

    Space restricted for use of residents, guests and service 
    people on legitimate assignments. In multifamily, this is ussually secured by
    protection officers, locks or other forms of physical barriers. Strangers can
    be expcted to be challenged as trespassers.

4. **Private**

    Space restricted for use of residents of a single dwelling unit,
    their invited guests and service people, with access controlled by locks or
    physical barriers.

### CPTED strategies

#### Natural Access Control



#### Natural Surveillance
#### Territorial Reinforcement

### Benefits of CPTED

1. Treatement of crime problems at various environmental scales.

2. Intergration of preventiont approaches.

3. Identification of short and long-term goals.

4. Encouragement of collective responses to problems

5. Interdisciplinary approach to urban problems.

6. Encouragement of better police/community responses.

7. Development of security guidelines and standards

8. Assistance in urban revitalization

9. Acquisition of development funds

10. Institutionalization of crime prevention policies and practises.
