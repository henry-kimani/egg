Inviduals, entities and governments are driven by a mission to created value.

Assets helps us create value.

Leaders and manager are tasked to provide strategic directions to create value
and they need to understand what creates value and what destroys it, to succeed
in their endeavour.

### Asset

An asset is something/somebody of value.

1. **Physical assets**

    Physical assets include tangible and non-tangible. Tangible assets are include
    property and physical goods. Intangible assets include cash, bonds and 
    financial assets.

2. **People**

    People are an important asset as they lead to the creation of other assets.
    They include, employees, contractors, vistors, customers and suppliers.

3. **ICT**

    It involves an integration of various components such as telecommunication,
    computers and the network that assit in creating, managing and distrubution
    information rapidly. This helps improve an organization's value.

4. **Information**

    Informational assets include structural, relational and human catergories
    of information. They include, hard copy, electronic or conceptual or any
    other form of information that can be stored, retrived or used.

### Security Drivers

A security driver is something that demands to have some level of protection in
order to protect assets.

#### Threats

Threats are anything that can go wrong or attack the system.

It could also be defined as the declaration of intent to cause harm. It is assessed
by considering aspects of capability and intent. Examples include:
- man made disasters
- natural disasters

Security managers should identify threats against the assets by considering factors
such as the environment, culture, products and services.

1. **Natural threats**

    They are not manufactured by people but by acts of God. They are consistent
    in the way they occur and can be deduced from historical events. Therefore,
    we ought to learn as much as possible and design appropriate security systems
    for adequate preparedness.

2. **Man-made threats**

    They are manufactured by human beings. Since humans are ratinal actors, if 
    motivated and presented with an opportunity they can take advantage of the
    system's weaknesses and lauch an attack against the assets.

    Given their dynamic occurance, they are inconsistent. However, gathering 
    historical and crime data and analysing it, it would be possible to predict
    future occurrences and mitigate them.

#### Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities are those things that make the facility more prone to attack by
the threats. Vulnerabilities are exploited by threats. For example, a lack of 
access control (vulnerability) can be exploited by a person (threat).

The global and security environment, is always changing, therefore, no security
system is 100% secure. Organizations should take steps to periodically assess
they facilities and revist their security systems for vulnerabilities.

#### Risk

We assess risk by considering the likelihood and impact of the security threat
manifesting which may cause harm, loss or damage to assets.

To guarantee a successful security system, security managers should establish
a security risk management program/framework.

Counter measures are things that reduce opportunities for threats to exploit 
vulnerabilities. For example, an access control system is a countermeasure that
can block entrance by a threat.

##### Security Assessment

- **Risk Assessment** 

    This is process of identifying and prioritizing risks. Its a quantitative,
    qualitative or hybrid assessment that seeks to determine the likelihood that
    an adversary will exploit a vulnerability and the resulting impact to an asset.

- **Threat Assessment**

    An evaluation of human actions or natural events that can adversely affect
    business operations and specific assets. Historical information is a primary
    source for threat assessments, including past criminal and terrorist events.
    For example, crime analysis is a quantitative threat assessment while 
    terrorism is a qualitative threat assessment.

- **Vulnerability Assessment**

    An analysis of security weaknesses and opportunities for adversarial exploitation.
    A security survey is the fundamental tool for collecting information used
    in vulnerability assessment.

##### Methods of risk assessment

1. **Qualitative Assessments**

    They are normally used when the assest that are int need of protection are of 
    lower value or when data is not available. The results depends on the skills
    of the people involved. Risk is ussually given in abstract values e.g high,
    medium or low.

2. **Quantitative Assessment**

    They are metric based and assign numerical values to the risk level. In a
    physical protection system, for example, the metrics used in determining the
    risk level include:
    - the threat level,
    - probability of detection, 
    - delay times and
    - response force times.

    It is ussually used in business critical or high value assets.
