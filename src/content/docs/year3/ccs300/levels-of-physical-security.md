### Minimum Security 

Such systems would be designed to **impede** some unauthorized external activity.

Unauthorized external activity is defined as originating outside the scope of the 
security system and could range from simple instrusion to attack.

By this definition, a minimum security system would consist of simple physical
barriers such as regular doors and windows equipped with ordinary locks. For example,
the average Kenyan home

### Low-level Security

They are designed to **impede** and **detect** some unauthorized external activity.

Once simple physical barriers and locks are in place, they could be supplemented
with other barriers such as
- reinforced doors,
- window bars and gates,
- high security locks
- a simple lighting system lighting over doors and windows
- a basic alarm system that would be unmonitored and placed on the site of intrusion
to provide detection capability and local ammuncation.

Such areas include, small stores, storage houses or old police stations.

### Medium Security

Such systems would be designed to **impede**, **detect** and **assess** most
unauthrozied activity and some unauthorized internal activity. 

Such activity could range from simple shoplifting to conspiracy to commit sabotage.

To reach medium security level, its necessary to:

1. Incorporate an advanced intrusion alarm system that annuniciates at a staffed
remote location.

2. Establish a perimeter beyond the confines of the area being protected and provide
high-security barriers, such as penetration-resistant fences at least 6-8ft high
and topped with multiple strands of barbared wire or barbered tape at that perimeter
or use guards dogs in lieu of perimeter protection.

3. Use an unarmed security officer(with basic training) equipped with a means of 
basic communication e.g cell phone

Examples of medium level security include, bonded warehouses, large industrial
manufacturing plants and National Guard armories.

### High-level Security

A system with level security would be designed to **impede**, **detect** and 
**access** most unauthorized external and internal activity.

A high level of security can be realized by:

1. State of art equipment installed.

2. Security surveillance systems (CCTV) with digital state of art components
and installation.

3. A perimeter alarm system, remotely monitored, at or near the high security
physical barriers.

4. High-security lighting (LED) which at a minimum provides at least provides
0.05 foot-candles of light.

5. Highly trained armed security officers or unarmed security officers who have
been screened for employment and equipped with advanced means of communication.

6. Controls designed to control access to or within a facility to authorized
personnel such as biometrics.

7. Formal plans prepared with knowledge and cooperation of police dealing with
their response and their assistance in the event of specific contigencies at the
protected site.

8. Varying degrees of coordination with local law enforcement agencies.

9. Annual assessment or security audits conducted.

10. All should be checked on a monthly basis.

Such high level security sites include prisons, defense contractors, pharmaceutical
companies.

### Maximum level Security

Such systems are designed to **impede**, **detect**, **assess** and **neutralize**
all unauthorized external and internal activity

In addition to those measures already cited, it is characterized by the following:

1. A sophisticated, state-of-the-art alarm system too strong to defeat by a lone
individual, remotely monitored in one or more protected locations, tampered
indicating with a backup source of power and access control and biometrics.

2. On-site response force of highly screened and trained individuals armed 24 hours
a day, equipped with contingency operations and dedicate to neutralizing and 
containing a threat against the protected facility until the arrival of off-site
assistance.

Such security would be found in nuclear power facilities, some prisons, certain
military bases and government special research sites.
