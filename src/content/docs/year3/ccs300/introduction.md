Physical security refers to the protection of people, property and assets from
physical threats such as theft, validalism, terrorism, fire and natural disasters.
It involves the use of physical barriers, human guards and procedures to prevent
unauthorized access and ensure safety of facilities and personnel.

Technical security refers to use of technology based systems and devices to detect,
monitor, control and respond to security threats. It complements physical measures
by providing surveillance, instrusion detection and access control through
advanced tools such as CCTV, biometric systems, sensors and electronic alarms.

### Zones of protection

Zones are generally thought of as concentric circles - each zone refers to the 
content of the physical area within a circle.

A zone forms a line of protection; it is used to identify the level of security
required for a particular area.

1. **Zone One**

    It refers to the property the building is located.

2. **Zone Two**

    It refers to the building perimeter and its facade. This includes all the
    entrypoints to the inside of the building such as doors and windows.

3. **Zone Three**

    It refers to the "open" interior areas within the building such as reception
    areas, lobbies, halls, cafeteria's and open offices spaces.

    This zone also refers to those areas located in zone one that required 
    greater access control and tigher security measures. (equipment areas, storage
    facility).

4. **Zone Four**

    It refers to those high security areas where very limited access is allowed.
    They are ussually located within the building (computer room, laboratory)
    or outside the building.

    Power generating equipment, communications equipment, chemical tanks and 
    hazardous material storage can quality as zone four areas.


The application of mulitple zones, in a series of concentric circles, provides for
increasing security as you move towards the center. Each subsequent zone adds
another layer of protection to your operation's overall security system.

### Security Components

Security systems are made up of four main components, each of which must be
intergrated with the others:

1. Physical barriers
2. Technology
3. People

The components can be different depending on the location of the business.

The physical barriers and the technology used in a system depends on the needs
of the facility. The people, policies and procedures to employ are very specific
to the nature of the business environment. Therefore, the security system must 
constantly be tuned so that it is a coherent part of the local environment and
operation's accessed risk.

For example, laboratories have different needs than sales, medical materials
production is very different from production of industrial materials.

The effectiveness of a security system depends on who well its components are
integrated into its overall design. Integrating components into the whole is 
called layering. It refers to the layering of components and creating redundancy
so that the system has no weak points.

#### Physical barriers

Physical barriers are used to form perimeter lines of defense. They can successfull
deter an intruder, althought one should only count on them only to delay the
intruder.

Fences, for example, can ussually be compromized within one minute. 

At your facility use physical barriers in each zone of protection. Some examples
of the barriers used in each zone include the following:

1. **Exterior (Zone One)**: Natural terrain, landscaping, fencing gates, walls and
notification and warning signs.

2. **Building Perimeter (Zone Two)**: Building walls, doors, gates, windows, roofs,
hatches, access panels, grills, grates, and notification and warning signs.

3. **Building interior (Zone Three)**: Partition walls, furniture partions, doors,
gates, glass panels, railings, floors, ceilings, access panels, grills, notification
and warning signs.

4. **Restricted areas (Zone Four)**: Any of the physical barriers used in the other
zones, plus some form of fencing, walls and restricted access; notification and 
warning signs; locking cabinets for proprietary materials and information; and
vaults with combination locks.

#### Technology and Control Systems

Technology and control systems are used in a physical security system to monitor
and secure the environment and to detect intrusion.

The control systems options of you facility include the following:

1. **Exterior (Zone one)**: Locks and keys, perimeter alarms, motion detection, 
CCTV, instructional signs, security officers, electronic access control and 
lighting.

2. **Building perimeter (zone two)**: Locks and keys, alarms, annunciation, motion detection,
warning lights, electronic access controls, CCTV, security officers, receptionists,
other assigned people, instructional signs, employee badge/ID systems and visitor
badge systems.

3. **Building Interior (Zone three)**: Locks and keys, alarms, annunciation, motion detection,
warning lights, electronic access controls, CCTV, security officers, receptionists,
other assigned people, instructional signs, employee badge/ID systems and visitor
badge systems.

4. **Restricted Areas (Zone four)**: Same as zone three but with an additional
precaution of a dedicated controls system, including a dedicated response, provided
for the decidated area.
Additional zone four precaution include alarm monitoring devices, escored access
to restricted areas, full audit trail of all access, password or pin number
protections and biometric verification.

#### Human Component

Systems do not stand alone. People are responsible for ensuring that technology
is applied appropriately, systems are monitored and maintained and responses are
made to events that call for action. For example, a card access system is not 
effective if an authorized person leaves a door open for an unauthorized person
and management does not monitor and correct the system.

Installing a security systems does not guarantee that your security goals will
be met. A system that is installed for appearances only creates both a sense of
security and a host of legal issues.

##### People: The trusted person system

People are the cornerstone and collective strength of the security system at
every organizational facility, building and operation. Effective security depends
more on the awareness and support of the people in the workplace than in the
technology. People are trusted to perform their job with integrity. We know that
the vast majority of people in the workplace have a higher degree of loyalty
and dedication. It is critical that people are made aware of the risks to 
security associated with their work and understand their responsibilities for
maintaining a safe and secure workplace.

- Policies and procedures: A physical security program includes policies and 
procedures and the degree to which people follow and support these policies and
procedures determines the success of the operation's security system.

- Systems management: People are responsible for ensuring that all components of
a security system work together to provide comprehensive and consistent coverage
and that the systems is performing to its full capacity and delivering its desired
results.

- Training: Training and education programs keep people informed about security
risks, teach them about physical security procedures and techniques, show them
how to respond incase an incident occurs and ensures that everyone knows what 
resources are available. Systems training keeps people aware of the ways to detect
potential problems and ways to correct them.

- Monitoring: All security systems are monitored consistently to be efffective.
In addition, a program for designed response to information gathered by the
monitoring process is essential to the system's success.

- Response to alarms: A quick, consistent response to every alarm situation shows
that the operation is serious about enforcing security procedures and protecting 
your organizational assets.

- Informational reports and activity reports: These reports must reviewed to identify
any problems there might be with a security system. Follow-up and collective
actions must be taken when problems are identified.

- Validation testing: All systems must be periodically tested to ensure functionality
and performance. Validation testing includes getting answers to questions such 
as:
    - Do the right people take the correct action when an alarm situation occurs?
    - Are visitors being stopped and signed in?
    - Are ID badges being worn and checked?
    - Do alarm doors sound when they are opened?

- Now that security systems have evolved into digital networked platforms, all
of your organization's computer devices should follow applied standards. 
Partnerships between security and IT are now the norm. Maintaining security requires
24-7 reliability with very little downtime.

##### Responsibility of Critical Security Components

Security is a shared responsibility of every person within an organization.
However, some are more engaged than others.

Critial components of a security systems must be assigned as specified responsibilities
to individuals. These critical areas include:

- Systems management
- Systems maintainance
- Systems training
- Monitoring
- Response
- Information and activity reports
- Policies and procedures
- Personal security awareness
- Validation testing
