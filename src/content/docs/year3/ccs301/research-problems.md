### The problem: The heart of research process

The problem or question is the axis around which the whole research effort revolves.

The statement of the problem must first be expressed with the utmost precision;
it should be subdivided into manageable subproblems.

Such an approach clarifies the goals and directions of the entire research effort.

### Finding reseach projects

Wheather basic or applied research, the research project takes a significant 
amount of time and energy. Your problem should be worth that time and energy.

As you begin to identify a research problem, keep two criteria in mind.
- Your problem should address an important question, such that the answer
can actually "make a difference" in some way.
- It should advance the frontiers of knowledge, perhaps leading to new ways of 
thinking, suggesting possible applications or paving way for further research in
the field.

To accomplish both of these ends, your research projects must involve not only
the collection of data but also the interpretation of data.

Some problems are not suitable for research because they lack the **interpretation
of data** requirement; they do not elicit a mental struggle on the part of the 
researcher to force raw data to reveal their meaning.

#### Finding a legitimate problem

You must be sufficienly knowledgeable about the topic of interest to know what
projects might make important contributions to the field.

##### Strategies of finding a legitimate problem

1. **Look around**

2. **Read the literature**

    It is important to know what things are already known about your topic of
    interest instead of reinventing the wheel. Additionally, the existing literature
    it can tell you what is *not known* - what still needs to be done. For example,

    - Address the suggestions for future research that another researcher
    has identified.
    - Replicate a research project (in a different setting or with a different
    population).
    - Consider how different subpopulations might behave differently in the 
    same situation.
    - Apply an existing perspective or theory to a new situation.
    - Explore unexpected or contradictory findings in previous studies.
    - Challenge research findings that seem to contradict what you already 
    know or believe to be true.

    It also it gives you a theoretical base to generate your hypotheses and build
    a rationale for you study. It provides potential research methodologies and
    methods of measurements. And it can help you interpret your results and relate
    them to what is already known to the field.

3. **Attend professional conferences**

    Many researchers have find new research projects at national or regional
    conferences in their discipline and by attending these conference programs,
    they can learn what's hot and whats' not hot. Furthermore, novices can make
    contact with experts researchers in thier field where they can ask questions,
    share ideas and exchange contact information.

4. **Seek the advice of experts**

    Ask experts questions in their field such as, What needs to be done? What
    burning questions are still out there? What previous research findings 
    seemingly don't make sense.

5. **Choose a topic that intrigues and motivates you**

    Your selection should be based on what you personally to learn more about.
    Since research can take a long time, at times years, it should be something
    you believe is worth you effort - even better, you are truly passionate about.
    "You are going to be married to it, so you might as well enjoy it".

6. **Choose a topic that others find interesting and worthy of attention**

    Ideally, your work should not end with a thesis, dissertation or other
    unpublished research report. If you research adds an important piece to what 
    humans know and understand about the world, then it would be shared to the
    world. Additionally, other researchers maybe interested and publishers may
    publish the work.

### Stating the research problem

At the step of the process, successful researchers ask themselves:
- What am I doing? 
- For what purpose am I doing it for?

such questions can help you acheive your ultimate purpose for gathering data; to
resolve the problem.

1. **State the problem clearly and completely**

    You problem should be stated clearly state that anyone who reads english can
    read and understand it. 

    Some examples of poorly constructed problems are numbered which are followed
    by more complete sentences that describe a researchable partern.
    1. Use of dealy violence by youthful gangs.

        What factors can be associated with the increase of the use of deadly 
        violence by youthful gangs in Kayole?

    2. Busing of school children
        
        What factors must be evaluated and what are the relative weights of those
        several factors in constructing a formula for estimating the cost of 
        busing children in mid-western metropolitan school systems.

    Notice that, in the full statements of each of these problems, the areas
    studied are carefully limited so that the study is of a manageable size.

2. **Think through the feasibility of the project that the problem implies**

    Students sometimes rush into a problem without thinking through its implications.
    It's great to have ideas, however, its better to have practical ideas.

3. **Say precisely what you mean**

    You cannot assume that others will be able to read your mind. Your failure to
    be careful with you words can have grave results for you are a schoolar and
    a researcher.

    An imprecisely stated research problem can lead others to have reservations 
    about the quality of the overall research project. If a researcher cannot be
    meticulous and precise in stating the nature of their problem, others might
    question whether such a researcher is likely to be more meticulous and precise
    in gathering and interpreting the data.

    The problem should be stated in the very first words of an abstract: *"The
    purpose of this study is to..."* No mistaking it, no background build up
    necessary - just a straight forward plunge into the business at hand. All
    the research problems should be stated with the same clarity.

4. **State the problem in a way that it reflects an open mind about its solution**

    Occasionally, you may find research proposals in which the author state that
    they intend to prove that such-and-such is true. For example, a student may
    propose the following research project:

    > *In this study, I will prove that obese adults experience greater psychological
    disress than adults with a healthy body mass index.*

    This is not a research question, it is presumed - and quite presumptous! -
    answer to a research question. If the student already knew the answer to 
    the question, why were they proposing to study it?

5. **Edit your work**

    Editing is sharpening a thought to a gemlike point and eliminating useless
    verbiage. Editing almost invariably improves your thinking and your prose.
    Many students think that any thought that approximate a thought are adequate
    to convey to others. This is not so, *approximation is never precision*.

### Dividing the research problem into subproblems

#### Characteristics of subproblems

1. Each subproblem should be a completely researchable unit.
2. Each subproblem must be clearly tied to the interpretation of the data.
3. The subproblem must add up to the totality of the problem.
4. Subproblems should be small in number.

#### Identifying subproblems

##### Taking a paper-and-pencil approach

Using this approach, you write the problem in a piece of paper and the box off 
the subproblem areas. 

You might follow these steps:

1. Copy the problem in a clean sheet of paper, leaving considerable spaces between
the lines.

2. Read the problem critically to discover the areas that should be received 
in-depth treatment before the problem can be resolved.

3. Make sure every subproblem contains a word that indicates the necessity to
interpret the data within that particular subproblem.

4. Arrange the entire problem, which will now have the subproblems boxed off, into
a graphic that shows the research structure of the problem.

##### Every subproblem needs further delineation

The statement of the problem establishes the goal for the research effort. 

The subproblems suggests ways of approaching that goal in a manageable, systematic
way.

However, the goal is not enough to comprehend the full meaning of the problem,
therefore, we need more information as well.

In every research endeavor, the researcher should eliminate any possibility of 
misunderstading by:

1. **Stating the problem and/or the research questions**

    Describe the specific hypotheses being tested and/or the research questions 
    being asked. 

    Hypotheses are intelligent, tentative guesses about how a research problem
    may be resolved. Research questions are different in that, they don't any
    speculative answers related to the research problem.

    Hypotheses are essential to experimental research, whereas research questions
    are more common in many forms of qualitative research. Both hypotheses and
    research questions provide guidance for the kinds of data a researcher
    collect and suggest how the researcher should analyze and interpret those data.

    Both originate in the subproblems. Both provide a prosition from which the
    researcher may initiate an exploration of the problem and subproblem and
    also acts as a checkpoint against which to test the findings that the data
    reveal.

2. **Delimiting the research**

    Full disclose what the researcher intends to do and, conversely, does not intend
    to do. What the researcher intends to do is stated in the problem. On the 
    other hand, what researchers intends not to do is added in the delimitations.
    The limits of the problem should be carefully bounded.

3. **Defining the terms**

    Giving the meanings of all terms in the statements of the
    problem and subproblems that have any possibility of being misunderstood. 

    We won't necessarily agree with such a definition, but as long as we know what
    the researcher means when using the term, we are able to understand the research
    and appraise it appropriately.

    Even when a researcher make reference of another scholar's defintions, they
    should state its meaning for the purposes of the study.

    A formal definition contains three parts:
    - The term to define.
    - The genera, the general class to which the concept being defined belongs
    to.
    - The differentia, the specific characteristics or traits that distinguish
    the concept being defined from all other members of the general classification.

    > *For example, harmonic characteristics(the term to be defined) might be
    defined as the manner(the genera) in which tonal values are combined to produce
    individualized polyphonic patterns associated with the works of a particular
    composer(the differentia: telling what particular 'manner' we mean)*

    The research must be careful to avoid circular definitions, in which the terms
    to be defined are used in the definitions themselves.

    > For instance, if we were to define harmonic characteristics in a circular
    manner, we might describe them as *'those characteristics that derive from
    harmonic patterns found in the works of a particular composer'*

    Especially when taking about insubstantial (rather than substantial) 
    phenomena - phenomena that have no obvious basis in the physical world - it
    is often helpful to include operational definition. That is the researcher
    defines a characteristic or variable in terms of how the it will be measured
    in the research study.

4. **Stating the assumptions**

    Present a clear statement of all assumptions on which the research will rest.

    For instance, suppose we were attempting to determine - through a pretest and
    posttest design - whether the Cognitive Interview technique yields to more
    accurate witness recall than the Standard Police interview.

    The basis assumption here is both the pretest and posttest measure the accuracy
    and completeness of witness memory. Also, it assumes that the investigators
    conducting the interview are properly trained in their respective techniques
    and the witnesses are cognitively capable of recalling the events in question.

    We try not to leave nothing to chance in order to prevent any misunderstandings.

    > *To discover you own assumptions, ask yourself, What am I taking for 
    granted with respect to my problem?*

5. **Importance of (the rationale for) the study**

    In dissertations or research reports, researchers frequently set forth their
    reasons for undertaking the study.

    The most obvious and required rationale for a dissertation is to contribute
    to the elimination of an identified gap in the literature.
