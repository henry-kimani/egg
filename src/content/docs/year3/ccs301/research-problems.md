### The problem: The heart of research process

The problem or question is the axis around which the whole research effort revolves.

The statement of the problem must first be expressed with the utmost precision;
it should be subdivided into manageable subproblems.

Such an approach clarifies the goals and directions of the entire research effort.

### Finding reseach projects

Wheather basic or applied research, the research project takes a significant 
amount of time and energy. Your problem should be worth that time and energy.

As you begin to identify a research problem, keep two criteria in mind.
- Your problem should address an important question, such that the answer
can actually "make a difference" in some way.
- It should advance the frontiers of knowledge, perhaps leading to new ways of 
thinking, suggesting possible applications or paving way for further research in
the field.

To accomplish both of these ends, your research projects must involve not only
the collection of data but also the interpretation of data.

Some problems are not suitable for research because they lack the **interpretation
of data** requirement; they do not elicit a mental struggle on the part of the 
researcher to force raw data to reveal their meaning.

#### Finding a legitimate problem

You must be sufficienly knowledgeable about the topic of interest to know what
projects might make important contributions to the field.

##### Strategies of finding a legitimate problem

1. **Look around**

2. **Read the literature**

    It is important to know what things are already known about your topic of
    interest instead of reinventing the wheel. Additionally, the existing literature
    it can tell you what is *not known* - what still needs to be done. For example,

    - Address the suggestions for future research that another researcher
    has identified.
    - Replicate a research project (in a different setting or with a different
    population).
    - Consider how different subpopulations might behave differently in the 
    same situation.
    - Apply an existing perspective or theory to a new situation.
    - Explore unexpected or contradictory findings in previous studies.
    - Challenge research findings that seem to contradict what you already 
    know or believe to be true.

    It also it gives you a theoretical base to generate your hypotheses and build
    a rationale for you study. It provides potential research methodologies and
    methods of measurements. And it can help you interpret your results and relate
    them to what is already known to the field.

3. **Attend professional conferences**

4. **Seek the advice of experts**

5. **Choose a topic that intrigues and motivates you**

6. **Choose a topic that others find interesting and worthy of attention**

### Stating the research problem

At the step of the process, successful researchers ask themselves:
- What am I doing? 
- For what purpose am I doing it for?

such questions can help you acheive your ultimate purpose for gathering data: to
resolve the problem.

1. **State the problem clearly and completely**

    You problem should be stated clearly state that anyone who reads english can
    read and understand it. Some examples of poorly constructed problems are:
    1. Use of dealy violence by youthful gangs.
    2. What factors can be associated with the increase of the use of deadly 
    violence by youthful gangs in Kayole?
    - Palestrina and the motet
    - The study

2. **Think through the feasibility of the project that the problem implies**

3. **Say precisely what you mean**

4. **State the problem in a way that it reflects an open mind about its solution**

5. **Edit you work**

### Dividing the research problem into subproblems

#### Characteristics of subproblems

1. Each subproblem should be a completely researchable unit.
2. Each subproblem must be clearly tied to the interpretation of the data.
3. The subproblem must add up to the totality of the problem.
4. Subproblems should be small in number.

#### Identifying subproblems

##### Taking a paper-and-pencil approach

Using this approach, you write the problem in a piece of paper and the box off 
the subproblem areas. 

You might follow these steps:

1. Copy the problem in a clean sheet of paper, leaving considerable spaces between
the lines.

2. Read the problem critically to discover the areas that should be received 
in-depth treatment before the problem can be resolved.

3. Make sure every subproblem contains a word that indicates the necessity to
interpret the data within that particular subproblem.

4. Arrange the entire problem, which will now have the subproblems boxed off, into
a graphic that shows the research structure of the problem.

##### Every subproblem needs further delineation

The statement of the problem establishes the goal for the research effort. 

The subproblems suggests ways of approaching that goal in a manageable, systematic
way.

However, the goal is not enough to comprehend the full meaning of the problem,
therefore, we need more information as well.

In every research endeavor, the researcher should eliminate any possibility of 
misunderstading by:

1. **Stating the problem and/or the research questions**

    Describe the specific hypotheses being tested and/or the research questions 
    being asked.

2. **Delimiting the research**

    Full disclose what the researcher intends to do and, conversely, does not intend
    to do.

3. **Defining the terms**

    Defining the terms. Giving the meanings of all terms in the statements of the
    problem and subproblems that have any possibility of being misunderstood.

4. **Stating the assumptions**

    Present a clear statement of all assumptions on which the research will rest.

5. **Importance of (the rationale for) the study**
