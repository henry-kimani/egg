Research design consititutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement and
analysis of data. It includes an outline of what a researcher will do, from
writing the hypothesis and its operational implications to the final analysis
of data.

The choice of which design to choose depends on the nature of the problems posed
by the research aims, thus, the research problem determines the type of design
you should use, not the other way around.

The overall research design decision can be split into the following parts:
1. **The sampling design** which deals with the method of selecting items to be
observed for the given study.

2. **The observational design** which relates to the conditions under which the
observations are to be made.

3. **The statistical design** which concerns with the question of, how many items
are to be observed and how the information and data gathered are to be analyzed.

A research design must at least contain:
1. A clear statement of the research problem.
2. The population to be studied and how sampling will be done.
3. The procedures and techniques to be used for gathering information.
4. The methods used in processing and analyzing data.

Research design is best acheived by determining the research purpose. The research
purpose may be grouped into:

1. Exploration
2. Description
3. Explanation
4. Experimentation

### Exploratory design

An exploratory design is conducted when there are few or no earlier studies
to refer to or rely upon to predict the outcome.

Its focus is on gaining insights and familiarity for later investigation or 
undertaken when research problems are in a preliminary stage of investigation.

Its often used to:
- *establish an understanding* of how best to proceed in studing an issue or 

- what *methodology would effectively* apply to gathering information
about the issue.

Design is a useful approach for gaining background information on a particular
topic. Given that exploratory design is flexible, - it can address research 
questions of all types - it is often used to generate formal hypothesis and
develop more precise research problems.

Exploratory design generally utilizies small sample sizes, and thus findings
are not generalizable to the population at large.

### Survey design

Survey studies ask large numbers of people about their behaviors, attitudes and
opinions e.g people's opinion about police performance, conviction rates in the
criminal justice system.

The main purpose is to find out how members of a population fit in one or more
variables.

Therefore, surveys allow researchers to assess the wide variety of behaviors and
phenomena, than can be studied in a field research.

Survey research uses a sample of the population from which the findings can be 
generalizable back to the population.

The three of the most common methods of data collection are open-ended questions,
closed-ended questions and Likert scales.

#### Types

1. **Cross-sectional surveys**

    They study a single population or sample size during a single specified 
    time-frame and gives us a "snapshot" of opinion data. Cross-sectional surveys
    comprise the largest number of projects that are undertaken.

2. **Longitudinal surveys**

    The follow the sample over time and makes repeated observations enabling 
    researchers to track changes over time and to relate them to variables that
    might explain why the changes occur.

    - *Cohort studies.* This is the study of the same population each time data
    is collected, although samples studied may be different.
    - *Panel studies.* It utilizies the same sample from the same population
    over time.

#### Strengths

1. It is possible to obtain information from large samples of the population.

2. It is possible to gather demographic data that describe the composition of 
the sample.

3. It requires minimal investment to develop and administer.

4. They are relatively easy for making generalizations.

5. They elicit information about attitudes that otherwise difficult to measure
using observational techniques.

#### Weaknessess

1. Biases may occur, either in the lack of response from intented participants
or in the nature and accuracy of the responses that are received.

2. Errors may also arise from intentional misreporting of behaviors by respondents
to hide inappropriate behavior. For example a main(or a woman), may not openly
to beating their spouse.

3. Respondents may have difficulty assessing their own behavior or have poor recall
of the circumstances surrounding their behavior.

### Descriptive design

Descriptive research designs help provide answers to the questions who, what, 
when, where and how associated with a particular research problem. However, they
cannot conclusively ascertain answers to why.

Descriptive research is used to obtain information concerning the current status
of the phenomena and to describe "what exists" with respect to variables and
conditions in a situation.

For example, a researcher can conduct a study to find out about crime prevelance
in an area.

### Case study design

Case studies involve an indepth explanation of a single entity or phenomena 
(e.g a program, event, institution or social group) and collects detailed
information through a variety of data sources.

The goal of the case study is to provide an accurate and complete description of 
the case.

While the focus, is to approach the sigle entity individually and describe it 
as comprehensive as possible, thus, there are not generalizations to other samples.

Case studies often include in-depth interviews with participants, review of records
and observations.

### Field research design

The essential idea is that the researcher goes "into the field" to observe the
phenomena in its natural state.

The field researcher take extensive notes that are later coded and analyzed in
variety of ways.

> For example, a research could examine the socialization skills of children by
observing them while they are a school playground and then record all instances
of effective or ineffective social behaviors.

When the participants are no aware they are being observed, they behaviors
observed and measured reflect their true behaviors.

#### Points to note

Field researchers shouldnot disrupt that natural course of events they are observing.
This ensures they observe events in their true happening.

Field research involves the observation and detection of behavior patterns or
other phenomena that exist in the real world.

The design in useful for exploratory purposes, when we know very little or nothing
about a certain subject. The approach can provide a useful but overal description
of the participants and a series of events as opposed to isolated ones.

Field research is basically descriptive.

#### Limitations of field research

The researcher has no control over the setting.

The participants may not have an opportunity to display the behaviors or phenomena
the researcher is trying to observe because of factors that are beyond their
control. *For example, the children who are ussually aggressive may not be at
school that day.*

Observations are limited to overt behavior. The researcher cannot study unobservable
processes like attitudes or thoughts.

### Correlation

In correlation the aim is to determine whether two or more variables are related.

> For example, a researcher may be interested in determining whether age is related
to weight. In this case the researcher may discover that age is indeed related
to weight, however weight increases with age.
