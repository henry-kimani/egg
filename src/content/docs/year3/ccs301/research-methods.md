#### What research is not

1. Research is not mere information gathering.
2. Research is not mere transportation of facts from one location to another. The
essence of research is interpretation of data.
3. Research is not merely rummaging for information.
4. Research is not a catchly word to get attention.

### Research

A systematic and organized process of inquring that aims to discover new knowledge,
investigate existing phenomena, answer specific questions or solve problems.

It involves a structured and methodical approach of collecting, analyzing and interpreting
information in order to gain deeper understading of a subject to contribute to
the body of knowledge in a particular field.

It can take forms and conducted in a variety of disciplines that exist including
natural, social and humanities.

#### Characteristics of research

1. **Research originates with a question or a problem**

    An inquisive mind is the begining of research. Consider an unresolved situation
    that invokes this questions: What is such-and-such like? These are everyday
    questions and with questions such as this, research begins.

2. **Research requires a clear articulation of a goal**

    A clear, unambiguous statement of the problem is critical. Research should
    feature grammatically complete sentence that specifically and precisely 
    answer the questions.

3. **Research requires a specific plan for proceedings**

    Researchers plan their overall research design and specific research methods
    in a purposeful way so that they can acquire data revelant to their research
    problem. In addition to identifying the specific goal of your research, you
    must identify how you purpose to reach your goal.

4. **Research ussually divides the problem into more manageable subproblems**

    The researcher closely inspects the principle problem and uncovers the
    important subproblems. By addressing each subproblem, the researcher can more
    easily address the main problem. Otherwise, if they don't isolate the lesser
    problems from the main problem, the research becomes cumbersome and difficult
    to manage.

5. **Research is quided by the specific research problem, question or hypothesis**

    Having stated the problems and its subproblems, the researcher forms one or
    more hypotheses about what they may discover. The hypothesis provides a tentative
    explanation for a phenomenon under investigation. It may direct your thinking
    to possible sources of information to aid you to solve one or more subproblems.

6. **Research accepts certain critical assumptions**

    They are the sine qua non(essential conditions) of research. The assumptions
    must be valid as they set the bedrock upon which the study must rest.
    In your research its important for others to know what you assume to be true 
    with respect to your project. If the quality of your work was judge, others
    would know the knowledge you assume to be basic.

7. **Research requires the collection and interpretation of data**

    This data attempts to resolve the problem that initiated the research. The 
    significance of the data depends how the researcher extracts meaning from 
    them.

8. **Research is, by its nature, cyclical or more exactly, helical**

    The research process follows a cycle and the resolution of the problem or the
    tentative answer to the question completes the cycle. Research, however, is 
    rarely conclusive. For example, I exploring and area one comes across 
    addtional problems that need resolving and so the process must begin a new.
