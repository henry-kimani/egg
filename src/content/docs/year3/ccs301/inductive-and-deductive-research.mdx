The application of a scientific methods ussually involves deductive logic and
inductive reasoning.

Researchers might develop a hypothesis either from a theory (deductive logic)
or from observations of specific events (inductive reasoning).

### Deductive reasoning

Deductive reasoning begins with general statements(premises), through logical
argument and comes to a specific conclusion. 

If the premises is true and the reasoning is valid, the conclusion must also be
true.

##### How it works

1. Start from a general theory or premise(e.g based on existing studies).
2. Form a hypothesis: A testable prediction derived from the theory.
3. Collect data(e.g through surveys, experiments or stats).
4. Analyze: Does the data support the hypothesis? If yes, the theory holds up. If
no, rethink

      - If all roses are plants (premise 1)
      - And if all plants produce energy through photosynthesis(premise 2)
      - Then all roses must produce energy through photosynthesis (conclusion)

      - All humans are mortals (premise 1).
      - Socrates are humans (premise 2).
      - Therefore, socrates are mortals (conclusion).

      Imagine you are researching why people reoffend after prison (recidivism).
      You can start with a general theory from criminology: "Social bond theory"
      by Travis Hirschi, which says strong ties to family, jobs and community
      prevent crime.

      - **Hypothesis**

          If social bonds reduce crime, then released prisoners with jobs training
          programs (which builds bonds) should have lower recidivism rates than
          those without.

      - **Test**
          
          You can compare data from two groups: 1000 ex-prisoners in a job program
          vs 1000 without. You use stats to measure re-arrest rates over two years.

      - **Results**

          If the program has 20% lower recidivsm, it supports the theory. If not,
          maybe the theory needs tweaking (e.g bonds aren't enough without mental
          health support).

In deductive logic, enquiry is guided by a theory which preceds it.

Theories are speculative answers to perceived problems and are tested by observations
and experiment.


### Inductive reasoning

Inductive reasoning starts from a specific observations or sensory experiments
and then develops a general conclusion from them. It is often used to form
hypotheses.

In inductive reasoning, even if the premises is true, the conclusion is not
guaranteed to be true, though it is likely.

##### How it works

1. Collect specific data or observations (e.g interviews, case studies or field
notes).
2. Look for patterns. What repeats? What surprises?
3. Form a general theory or hypothesis based on those patterns.
4. Test and refine. Gather more data to strengthen or adjust the idea.

      - All giraffes that I have seen (repeated observation)
      - have long necks
      - Therefore, I conclude that (conclusion)
      - all giraffes have long necks.

      - Every swans I have seen is white (observation 1)
      - I have seen hundreds of swans (observation 2)
      - Therefore, all swans are white (conclusion)

      Suppose you are studing street gangs in urbans areas. You don't start with
      a theory, instead you observe specifics.

      - **Observations**
      
          You inverview 50 gang members and review police reports. You notice 
          many join gangs after family breakdowns, school dropouts or economic
          hardships. A pattern emerges: "Gangs provide a sence of belonging and
          protection in chaotic environments"

      - **Building a general idea**

          From the specifics, you induce a theory: "Gangs form as a result of 
          early childhoold trauma occasioned by family breakdowns and violence
          in the families with gangs offering alternative support systems in
          communities with weak social institutions."

      - **Refine**

          You expand to more cities or data sets. If patterns hold, it strengthens
          the theory. If not, you adjust it.

Inductive arguments provide probable but not certain conclusions. They are useful
for scientific exploration and forming generalizations.

However, there are problems with induction.
- How many observations must be made before we can reasonable draw a conclusion
that is reliable enough to generalize from.

- And how many situations under which conditions should the observations be made
so that true conclusions can be reached?

Thus, we should ensure we make a large number of observations, we repeat them
under a large range of circumstances and conditions and that no observations
contradict the generalization we have made from the repeated observations.

### Relationship between inductive and deductive reasoning

The two, aren't rivals, they are partners.

Criminology uses a hypothetico-deductive model: Start inductive (observe patterns
from a theory), then deductive (test it). For instance:

- **Inductive Phase:** From crime stats, you may notice more domestic violence
during economic downturns.

- **Deductive Phase:** Hypothesize "Economic stress increases family conflict",
then test with surveys.

In you BS'c projects, you might use induction for literature reviews (spotting gaps)
and deduction from experiments (testing solutions like community policing).
