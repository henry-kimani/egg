### Sampling

**Sampling** is the scientific process of selecting a representative sample. This 
is the planned way that we use to select subjects for a study from a relevant
population.

This is done because it is not practically possible to study an entire population
of subjects largely due to constraints of time and resources.

Sampling is ment to acheive two main goals

1. **Representativeness**
    
    The study of a representative sample brings about an understanding of something
    great/bigger than the sample we have selected.

2. **To allow us *to make references* from data about the larger population.**

    This however, admissible where probability techniques have been used in the
    selection of subjects.

### Population

A **population** is the entire group of people or events that poses the 
characteristic(s) you are interested in studying. 

The population is determined by your research problem.

In research one has to choose the population they plan to generalize their results
to or the **target population**.

It is often difficult to choose a representative sample from a 'target population' -
say a community of district. It is difficult to identify every member of the 
community as the number may be large or widely scattered geographically.

Research thus will draw a sample from the **accessible population** as tracking 
every member is time, labour and resource intenstive.

One must strive for **population validity** by ensuring the *accessible population*
is comparable to the *target population* in the characteristic(s) which appear
most relevant to the study. Therefore, the accessible population *representative*
of the target population.

A **sample** is a smaller group obtained from the population, where each member/case
is referred to as a **subject**. They are referred to as **respondents** in surveys.

##### What is the appropriate sample size?

- Large enough to represent the characteristics of the accessible population and
to an extent, the target population assuming the population validity exists.

### Sampling procedures

**Sampling procedures** are the steps taken when choosing a sample. This can be 
done through probability or non-probability sampling.

In order to select a representative sample, the research must have a 
**sampling frame** - a list of individuals used as the basis for the selection 
process of the sample. For example, students register, all banks in Kenya, a list
of women in prison.

The subjects or cases selected the become the units of observation in a study.

**NOTE**

1. The generalization about a population has to do with how accurate the sampling
frame is.

2. Often the sampling frame may not be possible to come up thus researcher may 
have to device a method of selection.

3. The target population could also be small, so you can take the who population
this is known as a **census**.

#### Types of sampling

#### Probability sampling

##### Random Sampling

##### Methods of random sampling

1. **Simple random sampling**
2. **Systematic random sampling**
3. **Stratifed random sampling**
4. **Cluster sampling**

#### Non-probability sampling

1. **Purposive sampling**
2. **Snowball sampling**
3. **Quota sampling**
4. **Convenient/Accident sampling**
