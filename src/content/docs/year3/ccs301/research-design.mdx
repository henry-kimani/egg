Research design consititutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement and
analysis of data. It includes an outline of what a researcher will do, from
writing the hypothesis and its operational implications to the final analysis
of data.

The choice of which design to choose depends on the nature of the problems posed
by the research aims, thus, the research problem determines the type of design
you should use, not the other way around.

The overall research design decision can be split into the following parts:
1. **The sampling design** which deals with the method of selecting items to be
observed for the given study.

2. **The observational design** which relates to the conditions under which the
observations are to be made.

3. **The statistical design** which concerns with the question of, how many items
are to be observed and how the information and data gathered are to be analyzed.

A research design must at least contain:
1. A clear statement of the research problem.
2. The population to be studied and how sampling will be done.
3. The procedures and techniques to be used for gathering information.
4. The methods used in processing and analyzing data.

Research design is best acheived by determining the research purpose. The research
purpose may be grouped into:

1. Exploration
2. Description
3. Explanation
4. Experimentation

### Exploratory design

An exploratory design is conducted when there are few or no earlier studies
to refer to or rely upon to predict the outcome.

Its focus is on gaining insights and familiarity for later investigation or 
undertaken when research problems are in a preliminary stage of investigation.

Its often used to:
- *establish an understanding* of how best to proceed in studing an issue or 

- what *methodology would effectively* apply to gathering information
about the issue.

Design is a useful approach for gaining background information on a particular
topic. Given that exploratory design is flexible, - it can address research 
questions of all types - it is often used to generate formal hypothesis and
develop more precise research problems.

Exploratory design generally utilizies small sample sizes, and thus findings
are not generalizable to the population at large.

### Survey design

Survey studies ask large numbers of people about their behaviors, attitudes and
opinions e.g people's opinion about police performance, conviction rates in the
criminal justice system.

The main purpose is to find out how members of a population fit in one or more
variables.

Therefore, surveys allow researchers to assess the wide variety of behaviors and
phenomena, than can be studied in a field research.

Survey research uses a sample of the population from which the findings can be 
generalizable back to the population.

The three of the most common methods of data collection are open-ended questions,
closed-ended questions and Likert scales.

#### Types

1. **Cross-sectional surveys**

    They study a single population or sample size during a single specified 
    time-frame and gives us a "snapshot" of opinion data. Cross-sectional surveys
    comprise the largest number of projects that are undertaken.

2. **Longitudinal surveys**

    The follow the sample over time and makes repeated observations enabling 
    researchers to track changes over time and to relate them to variables that
    might explain why the changes occur.

    - *Cohort studies.* This is the study of the same population each time data
    is collected, although samples studied may be different.
    - *Panel studies.* It utilizies the same sample from the same population
    over time.

#### Strengths

1. It is possible to obtain information from large samples of the population.

2. It is possible to gather demographic data that describe the composition of 
the sample.

3. It requires minimal investment to develop and administer.

4. They are relatively easy for making generalizations.

5. They elicit information about attitudes that otherwise difficult to measure
using observational techniques.

#### Weaknessess

1. Biases may occur, either in the lack of response from intented participants
or in the nature and accuracy of the responses that are received.

2. Errors may also arise from intentional misreporting of behaviors by respondents
to hide inappropriate behavior. For example a main(or a woman), may not openly
to beating their spouse.

3. Respondents may have difficulty assessing their own behavior or have poor recall
of the circumstances surrounding their behavior.

### Descriptive design

Descriptive research designs help provide answers to the questions who, what, 
when, where and how associated with a particular research problem. However, they
cannot conclusively ascertain answers to why.

Descriptive research is used to obtain information concerning the current status
of the phenomena and to describe "what exists" with respect to variables and
conditions in a situation.

For example, a researcher can conduct a study to find out about crime prevelance
in an area.

### Case study design

Case studies involve an indepth explanation of a single entity or phenomena 
(e.g a program, event, institution or social group) and collects detailed
information through a variety of data sources.

The goal of the case study is to provide an accurate and complete description of 
the case.

While the focus, is to approach the sigle entity individually and describe it 
as comprehensive as possible, thus, there are not generalizations to other samples.

Case studies often include in-depth interviews with participants, review of records
and observations.

### Field research design

The essential idea is that the researcher goes "into the field" to observe the
phenomena in its natural state.

The field researcher take extensive notes that are later coded and analyzed in
variety of ways.

> For example, a research could examine the socialization skills of children by
observing them while they are a school playground and then record all instances
of effective or ineffective social behaviors.

When the participants are no aware they are being observed, they behaviors
observed and measured reflect their true behaviors.

#### Points to note

Field researchers shouldnot disrupt that natural course of events they are observing.
This ensures they observe events in their true happening.

Field research involves the observation and detection of behavior patterns or
other phenomena that exist in the real world.

The design in useful for exploratory purposes, when we know very little or nothing
about a certain subject. The approach can provide a useful but overal description
of the participants and a series of events as opposed to isolated ones.

Field research is basically descriptive.

#### Limitations of field research

The researcher has no control over the setting.

The participants may not have an opportunity to display the behaviors or phenomena
the researcher is trying to observe because of factors that are beyond their
control. *For example, the children who are ussually aggressive may not be at
school that day.*

Observations are limited to overt behavior. The researcher cannot study unobservable
processes like attitudes or thoughts.

## Correlation

Correlation reseach design is a non-experimental research method that examines
the relationship between two or more variables without the researcher controlling
or manipulating any of them.

In correlation the aim is to determine whether two or more variables are related
rather than establishing causality.

> *For example, a researcher may be interested in determining whether age is related
to weight. In this case the researcher may discover that age is indeed related
to weight, however weight increases with age.*

The correlation between two concepts can either be:

1. **None:** no correlation e.g Coffee consumption is not correlated with height.

2. **Positive:** Where an increase in one results in an increase in another e.g
as height increases weight increases.

3. **Decrease:** Where one decreases, another decreases too 

4. **Negative:** Where increase in one, decreases the other or vice versa e.g
as coffee consumption increases, tiredness decreases.

The degree of association is often measurable.

To draw a cause-and-effect conclusion, researchers must use experimental research.

#### Correlational vs Experimental design

Correlational and Experimental research both use quantitative methods to
investigate relationship between variables. But there are important difference 
between data collection methods and the type of conclusion that can be drawn.

| | Correlational research | Experimental research |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------|
| Purpose | Used to test strength of association between variables | Used to test cause-and-effect relationships between variables |
| Variables | Variables are only observed with no manipulation or intervention by the researcher | An independent variable is manipulated and a dependent variable is observerd |
| Control | Limited control is use, so other variables may play a role in the relationship | Extraneous variables are controlled so that they can't impact your variables of interest |
| Validity | High external validity: You can confidently generalize your conclusions to other populations or settings | High internal validity: You can confidently draw conclusions about causation |

#### When to use Correlation research

1. **To investigate non-casual relationships**

    You want to find if there is any association between two variables,
    but don't expect to find a causal relationship between them.

    > *You want to know if there is any correlation between the number of children
    people have and which political party they vote for. You don't think having
    more children causes people to vote differently, its more likely both are
    influenced by other variables such as age, religion, ideology and socialeconomic
    status. But a strong correlation could be useful for making predictions
    about voting patterns.*

2. **To explore causal relationships between variables**

    You think there is a causal relationships between two variables, but its
    impractical, unethical or too costly to conduct experimental research that
    manipulates one of the variables.

    Correlational research can provide initial indications or additional support
    for theories about causal relationships.

    > *You want to investigate whethere green house emissions cause global warming.
    It is not practically possible to do an experiment that controls global emissions
    over time, but through observation and analysis you can show a strong
    correlations that supports the theory.*

3. **To test new measurement tools**

    You have developed a new instrument for measuring your variable, and you need 
    to test its realiability or validity.

    Correlational resesearch can be used to test whether a tool consistently or
    accurately captures the concepts it aims to measure.

    > *You developed a new scale to measure loneliness in children based on anecdotal
    evidence during lockdown. To validate this scale, you need to test whether
    its actually measuring loneliness. You collect loneliness using three different
    measures, including the new scale, and test the degrees of correlation between
    the different measurements.*

#### How to collect Correlational data

It is important to carefully choose and plan your methods to ensure realiability
and validity of your results.

1. **Survey**

    In survey research you can use questionnaires to measure your variables of 
    interest. You can conduct surveys online, by mail, by phone or in person.

    It is important to ensure that questions are worded in a unbiased way and 
    capture relevant insights.

    > *To find out if there is relationship between vegetarianism and income,
    you send out a questionnaire about diet to a sample of people from
    different income brackets. You statistically analyze the responses to determine
    whether vegetarians generally have higher incomes.*

2. **Naturalistic observation**

    It is a type of field of field research where you gather data about a behavior
    or a phenomena in its natural environment. It involves recording, counting,
    describing and catergorizing actions and events.

    It can include both qualitative and quantitative elements, but to access
    correlation, you collect data that can be analyzed quantitatively e.g
    frequencies, durations, scales and amounts.

    Naturalistic observation lets you generalize your results to real world contexts
    and study experiences that are not replicable in a lab setting. However, 
    data analysis can be time-consuming and unpredictable and researcher bias may
    skew the interpretations.

    > *To find out if there is a correlation between gender and class participation,
    you observe college seminars, not the frequency and duration of the students
    contributions and catergorize them based on gender.*

3. **Secondary data**

    Instead of collecting original data, you can use data that has already been
    collected for a different purpose such as official records, polls or previous
    studies.

    Using secondary data can be fast and inexpensive, however, the data can be 
    unreliable, incomplete or entirely not relevant, and you have no control over
    the reliability or validity of the data collection procedures.

    > *To find out if working hours are related to mental health, you use official
    natural statistics and scientific studies from several different countries to
    combine data on average working hours and rates of criminal illiness. You
    statistically analyze the data to see if countries that work fewer hours have
    better mental health outcomes.*


#### How to Correlational analyze data

After collecting the data, you statistically analyze the relationship between 
variables using correlation, regression or both.

You can also visualize the relationship between variables with a scatter plot.

1. **Correlation analysis**

    Using correlational analysis, you can summarize the relationship between variables
    into a correlatio coefficient: a single number that describes the strength and
    direction of the relationship between variables.

    With that number you'll quantify the degree of the relationship between variables.
    The Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient(Pearson's r), is commonly
    used to access a linear relationship between two quantitative variables.

    Correlation coefficient are ussually found for two variables at a time, but
    you can use a multiple correlation coefficient to for three of more variables.

2. **Regression analysis**

    With regression analysis, you can find how much a change in one variable will
    be associated with a change in the other variable.

    The result is a regression equation that describes the line of a graph of 
    your variables. You can use this equation to predict the value of one variable
    based on the given value(s) of the other variable(s).

    It is best perform regression analysis after testing for a correlation between
    you variables.

#### Correlation and Causation

It is important to point out that a correlation between two things does not
necessarily mean that one thing caused the other.

That is, correlation does not imply causation.

##### Directional problem

If two variables are correlated, it could be one of them is a cause and the other
is an effect. But correlational research doesn't allow you to infer which is which.

To err on the side of caution, researchers don't conclude causuality from 
correlational studies.

> *You find a positive correlation between vitamin D levels and depression: people
with low vitamin D levels are more likely to have depression. But you can't be 
certain about whether low vitamin D levels cause depression, or whether having
depression causes reduced intakes of vitamin D throught lifestyle or appetite
changes. Therefore, you can only conclude that there is a relationship between
these two variables.*

##### Third person problem



## Experimental design

Experimental design consists of two comparable groups:
- an experimental group
- a control group

The two groups are equivalent except the experimental groups is exposed to the
independent variables (also termed as treatment) and the control is not.

Assignment of subjects to either groups is based on chance(randomly).

To assess the effect of independent variables, researchers take measurements
on the dependent variable group.

A pretest is taken for all cases prior to the introduction of the independent 
variable in the experimental group. A second measurement, the post test, is taken
for all cases after the experimental group has been exposed to the independent
variable.

The difference between pretest and posttest is compared between the two groups.

If the difference between the experimental group is significantly larger than in
the control group, it is inferred that the independent variable is causally 
related to the dependent variable.

<Aside title="Example" type="tip">
  If a researcher is interested in the effects of a new medication on headaches,
  the researcher would randomly divide a group of people with headaches into
  two groups.

  One of the groups, the experimental group, would receive the new medication
  being tested. The other groupe, the control group, would receive a placebo
  (i.e a medication containing a harmless substance, such as sugar, that has no
  physiological effects).

  Besides receiving the different medication, the groups would be treated 
  exactly the same, so that the research could isolate the effects of the
  medication.

  After receiving the medications, both groups would be compared to see whether
  people in the experimental groups had fewer headaches than people in the 
  control group.
</Aside>

The ussually require hypothesis(prediction) to be formulated first, in order to
determine what variables are to be tested and how they are to be controlled and
measured.

#### Classes/Types of experiment

The classes of experiment are characterized by the amount of checking and control
involved in the methods.

1. **Pre-experiment design**

    The basic experimental steps are followed, but there is no control group. By
    using this design, the researcher studies a single group and does not make 
    any comparisons between this group and an equivalent non-treatement.

2. **Quasi-experiment design**

    Looks a little like an experimental design but the subjects are not randomly
    assigned to the groups.

3. **True experiment design**

    A true experimental design is one in which study participants are randomly 
    assigned to experimental and control groups. This is the most reliable of
    the three.
