Science is any system of knowledge concerned with the physical entiling unbiased
expectation.

Scientific method is a systematic and organized approach used to investigate
natural phenomena. 

It is applied by scientist scholars to make observations and 
formulate hypothesis, conduct experiments, gather and analyze data and then draw
conclusions.

### The Scientific Process

It a fundamental process for acquring and advancing scientific knowledge. It
involves developing scientific knowledge.

It is defined by this committment to the systematic observation of the empirical
world and strives to be objective, critical, skeptical and logical.

It involves a series of prescribed of text established over the years and typically
involves the following steps:

1. **Observation of a phenomena**

    Question about the natural world.

2. **Ask questions**

    Asking specific and testable questions. This arises from curious of how or 
    why something happened.

3. **Hypothesis**

    This is the proposal to explain the phenomena. It should be clear, concise
    and capable of being tested through experimentation.

4. **Prediction**

    The prediction is under specific conditions. Under the proposal and can be 
    tested through experimentation or a controlled environment test the effects
    of the variables tested.

5. **Experimentation**

    Researches conduct their experiments to confirm their prediction based on
    manipulating variables (independent) while measuring the effects on other
    variables (dependent).

6. **Data collection**

    During the experiment, data is collected through measurements of observations
    of other forms of data recording. The data should be systematic and reproducible.

7. **Data analysis**

    This involves analyzing data using statistics and mathematics where the 
    analysis helps determine whether the data supports of reputs the predictions.

8. **Conclusion**

    Based on the analysis of the data, draw a conclusion whether the hypothesis
    is rejected or supported.

9. **Dissemination**

    This involves spreading and communicating your research through e.g publishing.

10. **Peer review and repulation**
    
    Other science review research and attempt to replicate to verify the results.

11. **Theory formulation**

    If the hypothesis is supported in multiple experiments and accepted within
    the scientific community, it is elevetated and a scientific theory or law.

Scientific method is cyclic process with each cycle building on top of the 
previous.

Scientists may revisit their hypothesis, experiments and review their conclusions.

Scientic method is a flexible framework adapted to various scientific questions.

It is a powerful tool of advancing our understading of the natural world and 
the developing world.

#### Key characteristics of science

1. **Empirical**

    Science relies on observations and experiments to gather evidence and data.
    This makes it be grounded on real world facts rather than assumptions,
    opinions and traditions.

2. **Objectivety**

    This is the ability to see facts as they are, not as you might wish them to 
    be. You have to guard against beliefs, wishes or values. You must set aside
    all subjective considerations and prejudices.

3. **Verifiability**
    
    Scientific findings rest upon sense data i.e data gathered through our senses.
    They must be based on evidence that others can observe and measure.

4. **Systematic**

    Scientific research follows a sequence of procedures to collect and analyze
    facts about the phenomena under study. This helps ensure consistency and accuracy.
    On the other hand, anecdotal or personal belief knowledge might lack systematic
    scrutiny, making it less adaptable to new evidence.

5. **Replicability** (repetability).

    Experiments and findings should be able to be reproduced by other scientists
    to confirm their validity. This builds in the confidence of the knowledge
    produced. For example if a scientific show a link between diet and heart 
    disease, other scientists should be able to replicate the study and confirm
    the findings.
    
6. **Falsifiability**

    Science-based knowledge is testible and falsifiable, meaning it can be proven
    wrong if new evidence arises. This allows for the continous improvement and 
    refinement of knowledge. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity can
    be tested and potentially disapproven.

7. **Precision**

    Scientific knowledge is precise, its not vague and the use of exact 
    measurements. For example, instead of "most of the people are against women
    right to inheritance" say "95% of people are against women right to inheritance."

8. **Accuracy**

    This simply means truth and correctness of a statement or describing things
    in exact words. For example, a physician will not say a patient has slightly
    higher temperature, rather having the exact temperature.
