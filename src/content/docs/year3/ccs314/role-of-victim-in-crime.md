### Victim Precipitation

This is the extent to which a victim is responsible for his or her own victimization.

The concept of victim precipitation is rooted in the notion that, although some
victims are not responsible at all for their victimization.

Victim precipitation acknowledge that crime victimization includes atleast two
people i.e the offender and victim and both are acting and reacting before,
during and after the incident.

### Victim Facilitation

It occurs when a victim **unintentionally** makes it easier for an offender to commit
a crime.

A victim *may* in this way be a catalyst for victimization.

### Victim Provocation

It occurs when a person does something that incites another to commit a crime.
Provocation suggets, withhout the victims behavior, the crime could not have
occured.

Provocation, most certainly the offender is not responsible for the crime.
