Setting up EAC(Electronic Access Control) system requires careful planning and 
execution to ensure all components function optimally.

### Installation Best Practises

1. Planning and Site Survey

    - Conduct a thorough site survey
    - Security zone
    - System integration

2. Component Placement

    - Reader placement
    - Control Panels
    - Cabling Infrastructure

3. Testing and Calibration

    - Test each component individually before connecting to the larger system.
    - Calibrate biometric devices to ensure high accuracy in identifying 
    authorized users.

4. Compliance and Building Codes

    - Ensure the installation complies with local building codes and safety
    regulations.
    - Verify that emergency exists and fire egress routes are not compromized
    by access control systems.

### Wiring and Cabling requirements

Proper wiring is essential for the reliable operation of access control systems.

1. Cabling types

    - CAT 5/CAT 6
    - RS-485/RS-232
    - Shilded twisted pair
    - 18/2 or 18/4

2. Cable Routing and Management

    - Route cables in conduit; Use metal or plastic conduits to prevent wires
    from physical damage and reduce electro-magnetic interference.
    - Separating powerlines
    - Color coding wires for easy identification during installation and troubleshooting.
    - Accounting for cable length limits

3. Common Wiring Topologies

    - Daisy channing
    - Star topology

### Power Requirements and Back up Solutions

This ensures continous operation, even during power outages, especially in high
security environements.

1. Powering Components

    - Power over Ethernet (PoE)
    - Low-voltage Power Supplies

2. Backup Power Solutions

    - Uninterruptiable Power Supply
    - Battery Backup for Locks
    - Generator Backup

3. Power Consumptions Considerations

    - Calculate the power draw of the system to determine the appropriate power
    supply or UPS.
    - Consider using efficient devices like LEDs to reduce power draw

### Hands-on Exercises and Demonstrations

Practical exercises is valuable for hands-on learning and ensures a deep understanding
of the installation process.

1. Step 1: Installing a door reader and lock

2. Step 2: Configuring PoE-based Access Control Devices

3. Step 3: Testing backup solutions

4. Demonstrations: System integration with fire alarms
