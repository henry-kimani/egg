### Introduction to Biometrics

#### What is Biometrics

Biometrics refers to the measurement and statistical analysis of people's unique
physical and behavioral characteristics.

#### Types of Biometrics

1. **Physical Biometrics** Includes physical traits that are part of a person's
body.

2. **Behavioral Biometrics** Includes behavioral patterns of activity that are 
unique to an individual.

#### Advantages of Biometrics

1. **Unique** Biometrics are unique to each individual and are nearly impossible
to share or replicate.

2. **Convenient** No need to remember passwords or carry ID's.

3. **Secure** They can reduce the likelyhood of fraud or unauthorized access.

#### Challanges of Biometrics

1. **Privacy Concerns** Collection and storage of biometrics data raises privacy
concerns and leakage to this data can lead to identify theft.

2. **Accuracy** 

3. **Cost** Implementing biometric systems requires specialized hardware and 
sofware with can be expensive.

#### Authentication vs. Identification

Authentication requries a user to present a sample which is then compared with 
the stored template for a one-to-one matching.

Identification, a user's biometric sample is compared to a stored template in the 
database for a one-to-one matching to determine their identity.

### Biometric Technologies

#### Fingerprint Technologies

It is a biometric technology that identifies and verifies individuals based on
unique patterns on their fingerprints.

Each fingerprint has a unique structure or ridges and valleys, and no two people
share the same fingerprint patterns, even identical twins.

#### Ethical concerns

1. **Bias in biometric systems**

    Bias refers to the unequal performance or accuracy of biometric systems
    across different demographic groups, often resulting in higher rates for 
    certaion populations.

    - **Root causes**

        - *Training data:* In many biometric systems, especially for facial recognition,
        the training dataset may not adequately represent the diverse population.
        For example, if the data is predominately light-skinned individuals,
        the system may be less accurate in identifying people with darker skin
        tones.

        - *Algorithmic design:* Algorithms used to biometrics data processing can
        be inadvertently optimized for certain features that are more prevalent
        in specific groups. For example, facial recognition systems might be better
        at detecting features such as eye spacing or nose shape in individuals
        who fit the demographic profile of the training dataset.

    - **Consequences**

        - *Higher false positives/negatives:* Systems may misidentify individuals 
        from underresented groups, leading to false rejection(denying access
        to legitimate users) or false pretenses(allowing unauthorized users).

        - *Injustice and discrimination:* In high stakes environments such as 
        law enforcement or hiring, biased biometric systems can perpectuate
        racial or gender inequality, disproportionately affecting marginalized 
        areas.

    - **Mitigation**

        - *Diverse and representative training data:* Ensuring the training dataset
        includes diverse demographic characteristtics.

        - Bias audits and transparency: Regular audits and transparency in the 
        development of biometric systems can help identify and correct biases
        in algorithms
        - User feedback: Allowing users to report inaccuracies can help fine-tune
        systems and ensure that they are working for everyone.

2. **Surveillance and privacy concerns**

    Using biometric systems, particularly facial recognition, in public areas
    has raised concerns about mass surveillance, loss of privacy and government
    or corporate overreach.

    The ability to continously monitor and identify individuals in public areas
    without their consent has sparked debates about the balance between secuity
    and personal freedom.

    - **Surveillance risks**
        - *Constant tracking:* With facial recognition technology in public areas
        (airports, shopping streets), individuals can be tracked in real time 
        without awareness, allowing for constant surveillance and profiling 
        citizens.

        - *Chilling effect:* Knowing that their movements and actions can be monitored,
        might deter individuals from engaging in certain activities such as 
        protests.

        - *Potential for misuse:* Governments or private entities could misuse
        facial recognition to track individuals for reasons unrelated to security
        such as targeting geopolitical opponents.

    - **Privacy concerns**

        - *Lack of consents:* Most public surveillance systems operate without consent
        from individuals they are monitoring. This raises conserns about the right
        to privacy and the ability to control one's own data.

        - *Data security:* Biometric data is sensitive and permanent. If miused or
        compromized, it can have long-lasting consequences for individuals including
        identity theft or unauthorized surveillance.

    - **Mitigation**

        - *Clear regulations and oversight:* Governments and organizations should 
        establish clear policies and legal frameworks for the use of biometrics
        surveillance, ensuring it is only used for legitimate purposes.
        - *User consent and transparency:* There is should be transparency in how
        biometric data is collected, store and used. Individuals should have a 
        right to opt-in and opt-out of biometric systems especially in public
        places.

        - *Data protection laws:* Strong data protection and privacy laws should 
        govern the collection and use of biometric data, ensuring it is stored
        securly and only accessible by authorized parties.

#### Best Practises for Security and Privacy

1. **Use encryption**

    Encrypt biometric data both in transit and at rest, to protect against
    interception and threft.

2. **Implement multi-factor authentication**

    Combine biometrics with other authentication methods for enhanced security.

3. **Regularly audit the system**

    Conduct security audits to identify vulnerabilities and ensure protection
    to data protection act.
