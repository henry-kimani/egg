Access control programming involves managing access to resources or systems by
defining users, groups and setting up rules and policies to determine who can 
access specific resources and how they can interact with them.

### User and Group Management

User is represents an individual that can interact with the system.

Groups simply permission management by grouping users who share similar access
requirements.

#### Steps and User and Group Management

1. Create users
2. Management groups
3. Assign roles and permissions
4. Maintain user and group information

#### Best practises

1. Use groups to manage access rights for large user bases, reducing the complexity
of assigning individual permissions.

2. Follow the principle of least priviledge, ensuring users only have access to 
the resources they need.

3. Regulary review and audit user accounts and group memberships to ensure the
correct permissions are maintained.

### Access Control Polices and Rules

Access control policies define how users and groups can interact with system 
resources. These policies outline who can access what and under what conditions.

Rules are established to determine whether a user is allowed or denied access
to a resources based on these policies.

#### Types of Access control

1. Discretionary Access Control
2. Mandatory Access Control
3. Role-based Access Control
