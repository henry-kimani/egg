#### Risk Assessments and Security Needs Analysis

Before determining an access control system, it is important to conduct a through
risk assessment and security need analysis.

Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities specific to the facility
or environment.

Consider the value of the assets being protected, regulatory requirements and 
historial security incidents.

The assessments helps in determining the appropriate level of security and the
type of access control measures needed.

#### Access Control Requirements

Once the security risks and security needs are identified, define the specific 
requirements for the access control system.

The requirements may include the number of access points, types of credentials,
authentication methods and the level of integration with other security systems.

Also, consider scalability for future growth and the need for redundancy and
failover capabilities.

#### Design Considerations

1. **Zones**

    *Divide the facility into zones* based on security requirements. High security
    zones may include server rooms or executive offices, while lower security
    zones could be common areas.

    Then assign appropriate access control measures to each zone.

2. **Doors**

    *Identify all access points* including doors, turnstiles, parking gates and 
    elevators. Assess the specific requirement for each security poing such as
    - the level of security
    - the type of authentication needed
    - any environment factors

3. **User Groups**

    Define *user groups and access levels*. Users can be grouped by roles, departments
    or access needs. Each group is assigned permissions based on their requirements.
    The principle of lease priviledge is considered to minimize potential risks.

#### Integration with other Systems(CCTV's, Alarms)

Integration with other security systems enhances overall security and situational
awareness.

1. **CCTV integration**

    When door are accessed, cameras can automatically record the event or provide
    real-time monitoring. This integration helps in visual verification access.

2. **Alarm integration**

    Integrating access control with intrusion detection and alarm systems can
    trigger alarms when there is attempt for unauthorized access and alert security
    personnel.

3. **Intecom and Communication integration**

    Integration of intecom and communication systems allows for a two-way
    communication at access points for visitor verification and remote entry.

4. **Logging and Reporting**

    Integrating access controls events into centralized logging and reporting
    systems provides a comprehensive overview of security events and compliance
    reporting.
