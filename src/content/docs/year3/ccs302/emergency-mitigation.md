Mitigation is defined as a sustained action to reduce or eliminate the risk to
people or property from such hazards and their effects.

During a risk analysis, it is possible to identify opportunities that could 
either 
- eliminate an organization's vulnerability to a hazard or 
- substantially reduce the impact of the hazard.

Mitigation measures are generally focused on long-term measures on reducing or 
eliminating the impacts of a hazard, as opposed to preparedness, that focuses
on enhacing the capacity to respond. Therefore, preparedness is focused on short
-term recovery from an event.

### Guiding principles of Mitigation

1. **Initiation**

    Diasters offer unique opportunities to introduce mitigation measures within
    the three diverse contexts of reconstruction, new investment and the existing
    environment.

2. **Management**

    Mitigation measures are complex and interdependent and require widespread
    responsibility, therefore, effective leadership and coordination are essential
    to provide a focal point.

3. **Prioritizing**

    Where resources are limited, priority should be given to the protection of
    key social groups, critical services and vital economic sectors.

4. **Monitoring and evaluation**

    Mitigation measures need to be continually monitored and evaluated in order 
    to respond to changing patterns of hazards, vulnerabilities and resources.

5. **Institutionalization**

    Mitigation measures should be sustainable to resist public apathy(widespread
    social disinterest) during the long period major disasters.

### Mitigation Strategies

Mitigation measures involves:
- land planners: construction and building officials, both public and private
- business owners:
- insurance companies
- community leaders
- politians

The following measures are known to reduce risk.

#### Hazard Identification and Mapping

It is important to analyze what hazards are possible in a particular area, know
its possible effects and initiate effective mitigation measures. 

Geographical Information Systems(GIS) is used and has become universal and are 
the staples for all local planning organizations.

#### Design and Construction Applications

Designing and constructing structures that adhere to building codes, architecture
and design cliteria and follow soil and landscaping considerations support risk
reduction.

It only applies to new constructions, substantial renovations or renovations to
change the type or use of the building.

Performanced-based design and construction, especially in earth-quake areas is
critical. This concept incorporates not just safety requirements but continued
use of building in an aftermath of a disaster.

#### Land Use Planning

The strategies of land use planning offer many options of effecting mitigation
including:
- Acquisation
- Easements
- Storm water management
- Annexation
- Environmental review
- Floodplain managment plans

It also includes myriad zoning options such as
- density controls
- special uses permits
- historical preservation
- coastal zone management
- subdivisiong controls

An example of land use planinng would be, planting certain kinds of variety of
crops that are less affected by special kinds of disaster.

#### Financial Incentives

Financial incentives can be used to promote mitigation and reduce risks by:
- creating special tax assessments
- passing tax increases or bonds to pay for mitigation
- offering relocation assistance 
targeting government community development or renewal grants funds for mitigation.

Also, government grants or subsidies may help persuade commercial and other
institutions to include mitigation measures in their buildings and reconstruction
activities.

#### Insurance

Insurance provides for the tranfer of risk from the individual or the community
to the insurance company.

Insurance also provides use incentives such as, they can persuade to offer
reduced premiums for buildings, once hazard-resistance measures have been
incorporated.

#### Structural Controls

Structural controls are used to protect existing development. In doing so, they
can have both positive and negative effects on the areas they are not protecting.
Additionally, as the name implies, they are used to control a hazard, not reduce
it.

The most common form of structural controls is the levee, which controls against
floods.

#### Agriculture Mitigation Measures

Various measures can be applied in agriculture to mitigate the effects of
disaster. They include:
- The planning of shelter breaks, comprised of trees and shrubs to reduce wind
effects.
- Crop diversification
- Adjustments to crop planting/harvesting cycles
- Food shortage programs to insure against shortage arising from disaster.
