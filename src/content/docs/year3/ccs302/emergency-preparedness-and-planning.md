Preparedness, in the field of emergency management, is the state of readiness to
respond to a disaster, crisis or any other type of emergency situation.

The capacity to respond and recover from emergency and disaster events is only
developed through planning, training and exercising.

### The preparedness cycle

1. **Planning**

    It involves creating various plans for disaster response and recovery. It 
    begins with the risk assessment process.

    In the planning phase, vulnerabilities helps planners understand why disaster
    occur, where they are most likely to have the greatest impact and what would
    be the appropriate response.

2. **Organization and Equipment**

    For preparedness to be effective, it should include:
    - access to the equipment needed to manage response requirement
    - the organization or people and agencies through which the necessary response
    and recovery tasks will take place.

    Several catergories of equipment include:
    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which protects responders from the 
    effects of hazards
    - Communication equipment, which allows organizations to talk to one another
    - Special search and rescue equipment,
