Preparedness, in the field of emergency management, is the state of readiness to
respond to a disaster, crisis or any other type of emergency situation.

The capacity to respond and recover from emergency and disaster events is only
developed through planning, training and exercising.

### The preparedness cycle

1. **Planning**

    It involves creating various plans for disaster response and recovery. It 
    begins with the risk assessment process.

    In the planning phase, vulnerabilities helps planners understand why disaster
    occur, where they are most likely to have the greatest impact and what would
    be the appropriate response.

2. **Organization and Equipment**

    For preparedness to be effective, it should include:
    - access to the equipment needed to manage response requirement
    - the organization or people and agencies through which the necessary response
    and recovery tasks will take place.

    Several catergories of equipment include:
    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which protects responders from the 
    effects of hazards
    - Communication equipment, which allows organizations to talk to one another
    - Special search and rescue equipment, which allows responders to enter
    compromized buildings, navigate hazardous waters or detect signs of life.

3. **Training**

    Training of emergency response officials allows them to conduct the tasks
    required of them. 

    Additionally, it is not enough to train traditional officials who participate 
    in emergency management, but also the elected officials responsible for key
    disaster-specific decisions, the businesses and non-governmental organizations
    operating in the community.

4. **Exercise**

    The adage of "practise make perfect" is certainly true in emergency management.

    Training is important for preparedness efforts, this is because the few 
    officials who have experienced first hand disasters, have little applicable
    experience to rely on when these events occur.

    Practising can be in the form of, table-top exercises, functional exercises
    and full-scale exercises and identifying shortfalls or failures in planning,
    training, organization or equipment.

5. **Evaluation and Improvement**

    The final step in the preparedness cycle takes the lessons learnt and applies
    them in future iterations.

    Evaluation includes examing how the plans, equipment and trained staff respond
    to imagined scenarios and identifying where changes in planning, equipment
    and a more comprehensive training should be applied.

    Improvement is enforced after the result of an actual disaster experience.
    Since disaster show us the limits in our emergency management capabilities,
    we are able to identify the cost ratio of future spending and dedication of 
    time and staff resources.


### Importance of an emergency management plan

1. The reason for an emergency plan is simply that is saves lives and save money.

2. The aim of an emergency plan is to reduce the risk of life and health that 
individuals may face and to reduce the damage to property that often results 
from an emergency.

3. It also helps to locate the resources and the equipment that will be needed,
to inform their personlel of the dangers and the ways to avoid them and to 
quickly arrange for help when help is needed. This is better reduce confusion
that normally accompanies unforseen and disastrous events.

4. Proper planning can help reduce long term effects of both "human-made" and 
"natural" disasters and help an organization recover faster.

5. It also helps avoid the mistakes that are often made when an emergency strikes

6. Emergency planning helps organizations anticipate problems and possible 
solutions. It would not be possible to anticipate every emergency, however,
you will be able to develop appropriate responses for a wide range of occurrences.

There are 4 steps in the emergency planning process:

1. Establish a planning team
2. Analyze capabilities and hazards
3. Develop a plan
4. Implement a plan

### Emergency Management Plan

#### Step 1: Establishing a planning team

Form the team that will be incharge of developing the emergency management plan.

The size of the team will depend on the organization's operations, requirements
and resources. 

Involving a group of people is best because:
1. It encourages participation and gets more people invested in the process.
2. It increase the amount of time and energy participants are able to give.
3. It enhances the visibility and stature of the planning process.
4. It provides for a broad persective on issues.

Determine who can be an active member and who can serve in advisory capacity.
Obtain information from functional areas your organization such as Upper Management,
line management, Human Resources, Engineering and maintenance, Security etc.

Participants should be appointed by in writing by upper management and their
job description should also reflect this assignment. They should show their 
committement to emergency management.

#### Step 2: Analyze capabilities and hazards

This step involves gathering information about current capabilities and about
possible hazards and emergencies and then conducting a vulnerability analysis
to determine the facilities capabilities for handling emergencies. This helps 
identify the security posture of the organization.

    <summary>Sources of this information could be in documents such as:</summary>

1. Evacuation plan
2. Fire protection plan
3. Safety and health program
4. Environmental policies
5. Security procedures
6. Insurance programs
7. Employee manuals
8. Hazardous material plan
9. Risk management plan
</details>

1. **Involvement of other stakeholders** such as Local Emergency Planning Committee,
Fire Protection Department, Police Department, Emergency Medical Services
organizations, The Red Cross, National Weather Services, can help identify 
potential emergencies and available resources.

2. **Identify critical services and operations** around your organization as this will
help assess the impact of potential emergencies and determine the need for 
back up systems. Such critical services include: electrical power, water, sewer,
gas, telecommunication and transportation.

3. **Identity Internal Resources and Capabilities** that could be needed in an
emergency:
    - **Personnel** Fire Marshalls, hazardous materials response team, emergency 
    management services, security, emergency management group, evacuation team.

    - **Equipment** Fire protection and suppression equipment, communications
    equipment, first aid supplies, warning systems, emergency power equipment.

    - **Facilities** Emergency operation center, media briefing area, shelter areas,
    first aid stations, sanitation facilities.

    - **Organizatinal capabilities** Training, evacuation plan, employee support
    system.

    - **Backup systems** Arragements with other facilities to provides for services
    such as payroll, communication, production, customer services, emergency power
    and recovery support.

4. **Identify External Resources** that could be needed in an emergency. In some
    cases formal agreements may be necessary to establish the facility's relationship
    with providers of the external resources. 

    <details>
        <summary class="font-medium">The external providers include:</summary>

    * Local emergency management office
    * Fire department
    * Hazardous material response organization
    * Emergency medical services
    * Hospitals
    * Local and State police
    * Community services organizations

    </details>

5. **Conduct a vulnerability analysis** of the facility by listing all the 
    probability and impact of the potential emergencies. Consider both emergencies
    could occur within your facility as well as emergencies that could occur in your
    community.

6. **Estimate the probability of the emergency's occurrence**.
    - Analyze the potential impact of the emergency, the possibility of death
    or injury.

    - Assessing the potential property impact should include the Cost of replace,
    Cost of setup temporary replacement and Cost to repair.

    - Assess the potential business impact such as Business interruption, Employees
    unable to report work, Customers unable to reach facility, Imposition of fines
    and penalties or legal costs and Interruption of production distribution.

7. **Assess your resources and your ability to respond**. Consider each potential
    emergency from begining to end and each resource that could be used to respond.
    For each emergency ask three questions:

    - Will external resources be able to respond to us for this emergency as quickly
    as we may need them, or will they have other priority areas to serve?

    - If the answer is yes, move on to the next assessment

    - If the answer is no, identify what could be done to correct the problem.

        - Develop additional emergency procedures
        - Conduction additional training
        - Acquire additional equipment
        - Establish mutual aid agreements
        - Establish agreements with specialized contractors

#### Step 3: Develop the Plan
