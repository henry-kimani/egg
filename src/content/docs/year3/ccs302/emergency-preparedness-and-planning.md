Preparedness, in the field of emergency management, is the state of readiness to
respond to a disaster, crisis or any other type of emergency situation.

The capacity to respond and recover from emergency and disaster events is only
developed through planning, training and exercising.

### The preparedness cycle

1. **Planning**

    It involves creating various plans for disaster response and recovery. It 
    begins with the risk assessment process.

    In the planning phase, vulnerabilities helps planners understand why disaster
    occur, where they are most likely to have the greatest impact and what would
    be the appropriate response.

2. **Organization and Equipment**

    For preparedness to be effective, it should include:
    - access to the equipment needed to manage response requirement
    - the organization or people and agencies through which the necessary response
    and recovery tasks will take place.

    Several catergories of equipment include:
    - Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), which protects responders from the 
    effects of hazards
    - Communication equipment, which allows organizations to talk to one another
    - Special search and rescue equipment, which allows responders to enter
    compromized buildings, navigate hazardous waters or detect signs of life.

3. **Training**

    Training of emergency response officials allows them to conduct the tasks
    required of them. 

    Additionally, it is not enough to train traditional officials who participate 
    in emergency management, but also the elected officials responsible for key
    disaster-specific decisions, the businesses and non-governmental organizations
    operating in the community.

4. **Exercise**

    The adage of "practise make perfect" is certainly true in emergency management.

    Training is important for preparedness efforts, this is because the few 
    officials who have experienced first hand disasters, have little applicable
    experience to rely on when these events occur.

    Practising can be in the form of, table-top exercises, functional exercises
    and full-scale exercises and identifying shortfalls or failures in planning,
    training, organization or equipment.

5. **Evaluation and Improvement**

    The final step in the preparedness cycle takes the lessons learnt and applies
    them in future iterations.

    Evaluation includes examing how the plans, equipment and trained staff respond
    to imagined scenarios and identifying where changes in planning, equipment
    and a more comprehensive training should be applied.

    Improvement is enforced after the result of an actual disaster experience.
    Since disaster show us the limits in our emergency management capabilities,
    we are able to identify the cost ratio of future spending and dedication of 
    time and staff resources.

### Emergency Management Plan

The reason for an emergency plan is simply that is saves lives and save money.
The aim of an emergency plan is to reduce the risk of life and health that 
individuals may face and to reduce the damage to property that often results 
from an emergency.


There are 4 steps in the emergency planning process:
1. Establish a planning team
2. Analyze capabilities and hazards
3. Develop a plan
4. Implement a plan
