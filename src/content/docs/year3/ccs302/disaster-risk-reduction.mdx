#### Definitions

Risk refers to the potential for loss or damage that occurs a threat exploits a
vulnerability leading to negative consequences like financial loss, reputation
damage or operational disruption.

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing and controlling risk. As
no individual or organization is free from all hazards, there should be a system
in place that ensures a systematic and structure approach to mitigating and
preparedness efforts.

Resilience is the ability to maintain essential functions, withstand adversity
from unwanted events and bounce back to a normal state.

## RVA (Risk and Vulnerability Assessment)

Before measures can be implemented, risks have to be identified and vulnerabilities
have to be mapped. This process is called Risk and Vulnerability Analysis (RVA).

### Bowtie Model

Bowtie model is one of the popular models of RVA. 

It looks like a mans' bowtie with causes to the left, a top event in the middle
and outcomes to the right.

#### Step 1: Preparation and Planning

Before starting the process of identifying and assessing risk, you should define
a mandate, a plan and a clearly defined scope. Divide the analysis object into
smaller sections and rather perform multiple and more pointed analysis.

Before you start analyzing, spend some time collecting as much background
information about the analysis object as possible.

#### Step 2: Analysis

1. **Threat Identification**

    The analysis process starts by detecting threats, identifying events or 
    happenings that may cause the top event. For example, hazards can be natural,
    man-made, hybrid or intended and unintended.

2. **Consequence Identification**

    It involves detailing the potential adverse outcomes that can occur if the 
    "top event" takes place. The consequnces are identified across the following
    four value groups.

3. **Barrier Mapping**

    Barries are often classified as people(personnel that operates, maintain
    and monitors), processes and plant(technical equipment and structures).

    On the bowtie-model's left side(threat), barriers are those mechanisms an
    organization of society has in place to prevent echo scenario from unfolding.

    On the right side(consequences), barriers are those tools that help the object
    mitigate or recover from the loss of control or an exalting negative development.

4. **Vulnerability Assessment**

    Barriers help give you a good overview of existing protection mechanisms,
    however, they are vulnerabilities that make them less useful or unrealiable.
    A vulnerability assessment identifies and outlines weakeness.

    For example, 
    - Organization vulnerabilities; lacking or inadequate policies, manadates or RVA.
    - Technological; features like access control, CCTV, external power supply.
    - Human vulnerabilities; lacking inadequate training, understanding situational
    awareness.

5. **Likelihood Assessment**

    The likelihood is the probability of occurence. Adding it a RVA-analysis would
    help analysis-group and decision-makers to make the right mitigation and 
    preparedness priorities.

    The likelihood can be presented in 5-point scale, where one = very unlikely
    and five = very likely based on the acquired information.

#### Step 3: Presentation and Recommendation

When analysis is complete, compile the results, present the overall assessment
or risk and make recommendations. Although the form and scope my very from organization
to organization, the golden rule of thumb is keep it as simple as possible.

Clearly state what hazard and the top event has been analyzed, who participated 
in the process and what they found. The recommendation should be clear, concrete
and realistic.

### Evaluating Risk

Evaluation of risk examines the likelihood and impact of each risk and ranks them
in a risk level threat matrix. The organization leader or project manager can
then decide on which threats to focus resources.

Threats can:
- impact an organization's strategic plan,
- cause financial damage
- have operational implications
- risk regulatory compliance
- cause damage to the organization's reputation

| | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
|-----------------| -----------| -----------| --------|
| High potential | Moderate | Substantial | Critical |
| Medium potential | Acceptable | Moderate | Substantial |
| Low potential | Minimal | Acceptable | Moderate |

The most used evaluation technique involves determing likelihood and consequence.
Ussually these metrics are defined using one or more of the following three methods:

- **Qualitative:** Using descriptive and terms and phases to assess and define risk
- **Quantitative:** Using calculated or historical data
- **Combiled qualitative / quantitative:** Using number to provide ordinal or 
comparative assessment of likelihood, consequence and / or risk.
