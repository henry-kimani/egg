**Emergency Management** is defined as a comprehensive framework or processes, policies
and actions aimed at minimizing the adverse effects of disasters, emergencies
and crises on individuals, communities and society as a whole. 

Essentially, dealing with risk and risk avoidance.

Emergency management involves the coordination and intergration of various 
disciplines, agencies and stakeholders to effectively *prepare for*, *respond to*,
*recover from* and *mitigate* the impacts of a wide range of hazards.

A **disaster** is a sudden devastating event that causes serious distruption of 
the functioning of a community or a society with widespread human, material,
economic and/or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected
community or society to cope with its own resources.

A **crisis**, as defined by The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
is an acute emotional upset; it is manifested in the inability to cope emotionally,
cognitively or behaviorally and to solve problems as usual.

Disasters and crises are not connected with certain time or place, but both can
happend suddenly and lead to catastrophic situations.

Disasters are urgent events that have different impacts according to type and 
size. They cannot be prevented, but its effects can be mitigated e.g floods, fire etc.

Crises are progressive urgencies that represent a major threat to the interest
of the state, are accompanied by high pressure and tensions and can possibly
ameliorated by negociations e.g airplace highjacking, hostage taking.

### Principles of Emergency Management

1. **Comprehensive Approach**

    - comprehensive - means complete

    Emergency managers should consider and take into account all hazards, all phases,
    all stakeholders and all impact relevant to disasters.

2. **Progressive**

    Emergency managers should anticipate future disasters and take preventive
    preparatory measures to build disaster resilience.

3. **Risk-driven**

    Emergency managers use sound risk management policies (hazard identification,
    risk analysis and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources to
    help identify potential hazards, evaluate potential impacts and prioritize
    resources and actions accordingly.

4. **Intergrated**

    Emergency managers ensure unity of effort among all levels of government and
    all elements of the community.

5. **Collaborative**

    Emergency managers must created and sustain broad and sincere relationship
    among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate trust
    atmosphere, build concensus and facilitate communication.

6.  **Coordinated**

    Emergency managers synchorize the activities of all relevant stakeholders
    to achive a common purpose.

7. **Flexible**

    Emergency managers should use creative and innovative approaches in solving 
    disaster challenges. Because of the evolving nature of emergencies, it helps
    emergency managers to be scable and dynamic.

8. **Professional**

    Emergency managers should value a science and knowledge-base approach based
    on education, training, experience, ethical practise, public stewardship
    and continous improvement.

### Importance of Emergency Management

#### Economic Consequences

1. **Loss of infrastructure and property**

2. **Business distruption and losses**

3. **Decreased trade and tourism**

4. **Increased government spending**

5. **Economic inequality**

#### Social Consequences

1. **Loss of life and physical injuries**

2. **Displacement and homelessness**

3. **Social disruption and disintergration**

4. **Psychological and emotional distres**

5. **Social inequality**

#### Environmental Consequences

1. **Ecosystem degredation**

2. **Pollution and contamination**

3. **Climate change feedback**

4. **Disruption of natural resources management**

### Clasification of disasters

#### Nature

1. **Hydro-meteorological disasters**

    They include natural processes of phenomena of atmospheric, hydrological or
    oceaniographic nature that may cause loss of life or injury, property 
    damage, social and economic distruption or environmental degradation e.g
    floods, wave surges, avalanches or droughts.

2. **Geophysical disasters**

    They are natural earth processes that may cause loss of life of injury,
    property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.
    e.g earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions.

3. **Biological disasters**

    They are processes of organic origins or those conveyed by biological vectors,
    including exposure to pathogenic microorganisms, toxins and bioactive substances,
    which may cause loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic
    disruption or environmental degradation. e.g epidemics, animal/insect plagues

#### Humans

**Technological or manmade disaster**.
Humans cause disasters(conflicts, famine, refugees, nuclear explosives) either
intentially (terrorism) or unintentionally due to negligence. 

#### Hybrid

Theses are the type of disasters where its starts with human action but becomes
complicated when nature plays its role in increasing the magnitude of the disaster.

For example, negligence in controling agricultural pests, which leads to damage
of agricultural production resulting in severve consequences for the community.

Negligence in review electricity connections, which leads to fires in town and 
electricity stations that consequently lead to human and material losses.
