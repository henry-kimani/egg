**Emergency Management** is defined as a comprehensive framework or processes, policies
and actions aimed at minimizing the adverse effects of disasters, emergencies
and crises on individuals, communities and society as a whole. 

Essentially, dealing with risk and risk avoidance.

Emergency management involves the coordination and intergration of various 
disciplines, agencies and stakeholders to effectively *prepare for*, *respond to*,
*recover from* and *mitigate* the impacts of a wide range of hazards.

A **disaster** is a sudden devastating event that causes serious distruption of 
the functioning of a community or a society with widespread human, material,
economic and/or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected
community or society to cope with its own resources.

A **crisis**, as defined by The Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
is an acute emotional upset; it is manifested in the inability to cope emotionally,
cognitively or behaviorally and to solve problems as usual.

Disasters and crises are not connected with certain time or place, but both can
happend suddenly and lead to catastrophic situations.

Disasters are urgent events that have different impacts according to type and 
size. They cannot be prevented, but its effects can be mitigated e.g floods, fire etc.

Crises are progressive urgencies that represent a major threat to the interest
of the state, are accompanied by high pressure and tensions and can possibly
ameliorated by negociations e.g airplace highjacking, hostage taking.

### Principles of Emergency Management

1. **Comprehensive Approach**

    - comprehensive - means complete

    Emergency managers should consider and take into account all hazards, all phases,
    all stakeholders and all impact relevant to disasters.

2. **Progressive**

    Emergency managers should anticipate future disasters and take preventive
    preparatory measures to build disaster resilience.

3. **Risk-driven**

    Emergency managers use sound risk management policies (hazard identification,
    risk analysis and impact analysis) in assigning priorities and resources to
    help identify potential hazards, evaluate potential impacts and prioritize
    resources and actions accordingly.

4. **Intergrated**

    Emergency managers ensure unity of effort among all levels of government and
    all elements of the community.

5. **Collaborative**

    Emergency managers must created and sustain broad and sincere relationship
    among individuals and organizations to encourage trust, advocate trust
    atmosphere, build concensus and facilitate communication.

6.  **Coordinated**

    Emergency managers synchorize the activities of all relevant stakeholders
    to achive a common purpose.

7. **Flexible**

    Emergency managers should use creative and innovative approaches in solving 
    disaster challenges. Because of the evolving nature of emergencies, it helps
    emergency managers to be scable and dynamic.

8. **Professional**

    Emergency managers should value a science and knowledge-base approach based
    on education, training, experience, ethical practise, public stewardship
    and continous improvement.

### Importance of Emergency Management

#### Economic Consequences

1. **Loss of infrastructure and property**

    Emergencies can cause extensive damage to infrastructure including buildings,
    roads, bridges and utilities. The cost of reparing or rebuilding can be 
    substantial, straining government budgets and hindering economic recovery.

2. **Business distruption and losses**

    Emergencies disrupt business operations leading to reduced productivity, job
    losses and decreased revenue. Small business, may struggle to recover leading
    to leading to long-term economic impacts on local economies.

3. **Decreased trade and tourism**

    Emergencies reduce trade and tourism activities, as travel restrictions, 
    damaged infrastructure and safety concerns discourage economic transactions.
    This can leave long lasting effects on sectors reliant on tourism and 
    international trade.

4. **Increased government spending**

    Governments allocate sufficient resources when emergencies occur. This leads
    to other areas being underfunded hence the government will require additional
    funds allocated to those areas such as education or healthcare.

5. **Economic inequality**

    Emergencies tend to exacerbate existing economic disparities. Vulnerable
    populations, including low-income communities and marginalized groups, often
    bare the brunt of economic consequences, facing difficulties in rebuilding
    and recovering.

#### Social Consequences

1. **Loss of life and physical injuries**

    Emergencies can result in loss of life and cause physical injuries leading
    to grief, trauma and long-term health challenges for individuals and
    communities.

2. **Displacement and homelessness**

    People may be forced to evacuate their homes or become displaced due to damage
    or destruction. This can lead to temporary or prolonged homelessness, with
    social and phychological consequences.

3. **Social disruption and disintergration**

    Emergencies can disrupt social structures, community cohesion and everday
    routines. Communities may face social dislocation, increased crime rates and
    challenges in accessing essential services.

4. **Psychological and emotional distress**

    Emergencies can lead to long-lasting psychological impacts, including post-
    traumatic stress disorder(PTSD), anxiety and depression from the losses. 
    The phychological toll may affect individuals families and communities for 
    an extended period of time.

5. **Social inequality**

    Vulnerable populations, such as elderly, children, persons with disabilities
    and marginalized groups, are the most and disproportionately affected by 
    emergencies. Paired with other existing social inequalities, it further
    leads to increased social disparities.
    

#### Environmental Consequences

1. **Ecosystem degredation**

    Emergencies can cause server damage to ecosystems including deforestation,
    habitat destruction and contamination of water bodies. These impacts have long
    term ecological consequences affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services.

2. **Pollution and contamination**

    Emergencies such as technological accidents or industrial incidents can result
    in pollution and environmental contamination. This has detrimental effects on
    air and water quality, soil fertility and the health of ecosystems and 
    communities.

3. **Climate change feedback**

    Some emergencies such as extreme weather events, contribute to climate
    change feedback loops. For example, wildfires release a large amount of 
    carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming.

4. **Disruption of natural resources management**

    Emergencies can disrupt the management and sustainable use of natural
    resources, impacting sectors like agriculture, fisheries and forestry. This 
    can lead to food insecurity loss of livelyhoods and increased vulnerability
    to future emergencies.

### Clasification of disasters

#### Nature

1. **Hydro-meteorological disasters**

    They include natural processes of phenomena of atmospheric, hydrological or
    oceaniographic nature that may cause loss of life or injury, property 
    damage, social and economic distruption or environmental degradation e.g
    floods, wave surges, avalanches or droughts.

2. **Geophysical disasters**

    They are natural earth processes that may cause loss of life of injury,
    property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.
    e.g earthquakes, landslides or volcanic eruptions.

3. **Biological disasters**

    They are processes of organic origins or those conveyed by biological vectors,
    including exposure to pathogenic microorganisms, toxins and bioactive substances,
    which may cause loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic
    disruption or environmental degradation. e.g epidemics, animal/insect plagues

#### Humans

**Technological or manmade disaster**.
Humans cause disasters(conflicts, famine, refugees, nuclear explosives) either
intentially (terrorism) or unintentionally due to negligence. 

#### Hybrid

Theses are the type of disasters where its starts with human action but becomes
complicated when nature plays its role in increasing the magnitude of the disaster.

For example, negligence in controling agricultural pests, which leads to damage
of agricultural production resulting in severve consequences for the community.

Negligence in review electricity connections, which leads to fires in town and 
electricity stations that consequently lead to human and material losses.
